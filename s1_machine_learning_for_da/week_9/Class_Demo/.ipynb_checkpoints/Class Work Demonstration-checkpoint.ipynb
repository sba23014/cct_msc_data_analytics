it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversion in item converting one image format to another is a fairly easy since once you get past all the file header a pixel is a pixel the basic object are the same for all image this is not so for vector the basic object vary from one format to except in extremely restricted it is simply not possible to do a conversion between vector there is software for converting to and from cgm file on the contributor state that it run on and possibly the a more specific blurb would be most on the other it is quite possible to do a close rendering an image from one format using the primitive from a far a i no one ha put together a general toolkit of such but two different hpgl to postscript converter have

       " 'under literary critical analysis honest used toaster emporium in article hi going to try to do something that perhaps many would not have thought even i want to begin the process of initiating a literary critical study of the pornography posted on to identify the major theme and motif present in the story posted there opening up then the possibility of an objective moral evaluation of the material present first let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about sick you are you are all going to which seems to be the usual post found on the you get you be argued i personally think that your project is built on unsteady i do not believe that there is any way to find an morality and value are inherently subjective they represent the belief of a person or a group of they can be widely perhaps even overwhelmingly but they are never and never be a christian bedrock assumption that all that is come truly from regarding while perhaps even from an objective the majority of it material is indeed repugnant come to this conclusion quite quickly when you start thinking about analyzing it material like some of it reflects some fairly profound need in people a well a some truth and deserve to be pointed i do not accept the assumption that you make a you you are trying to be then why accept a morality to begin with by using the christian defeating your own purpose by doing in the long the advantage of making such a analysis is that it will save between christian and non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of the stuff on these call me a but you stop the there will always be people who pop upin to tell u how sick and twisted and evil we all just out of do reader show up unprovoked in the religion group to tell you all that you are overbearing there should not be a dissonance between a morality and a either there is value in a particular or there is not whether one is a christian or let me provide an four people get together over to discus a rather conservative and a i start off by saying that i think immoral to force people to have sex with you but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own a i really know your view on i am just using this a a common view of morality for the purpose of this the moslem say that it is immoral for woman to have their face the who ha become kill all three of u and eats but feel no guilt because he ha done nothing wrong morally in his own in support for the first the christian scripture say not going to accept your evidence for you ask u to accept word of that everything good come from this is only a valid argument for a person who share your i must say that cataloging the major theme and motif in erotica could be interesting for other reason than so good luck with this next now then what are some of the major in the pornographic literature on place like these are some that been able to please on motif the in so many of the story there is expressed a feeling of alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object other of often a story involves a protagonist who the is quite average underneath usually ha an enormous who desire to in some way to gain access a definitely sexual to the other person who confesses is far more desireable than is and who indeed seems walk between the i detect just a wee bit of condescence motif a celebration of preoccupation not very the vast majority of pornographic literature deal with be it innocence about to be or simply physical and most people christian or non will say that beauty is one could construe this to mean that beautiful people are or than i would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily motif dick is instrument of might i suggest the word it seems more in line with the tone of your blessed are those who are for they shall get from what would thus be a revised matthew i respect you and your sense of motif sex a an expression of sincere there often a clear desire on the part of the to give pleasure to the object of and this theme is usually what the better story are they are not always selfish i could point to example in the work of elf for motif describes a sex which is completely removed from the realm of so removed is sex from it procreative dimension on that one begin to wonder why sex even involves a in the context described in pornography it serf then no real it serf the same purpose a it doe in pornographic it affirms the virility of the male a well a assuring the reader that he ha the whole picture is probably very well described by the catholic teaching on of the husband and in an act of total mutual in the sexual cooperating with god in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life humane your whole picture unfortunately only applies to people who accept your in if sex is for then why did god make it so that people would want to do rather than building it in a why did god make it not every sexual encounter result in even among doe this mean that they have in any case and the catholic teaching will probably not see eye to eye on this for a long motif sex used a an instrument power and why pornography seems to tend in that i really do not probably volume could be written on the relationship between sex and but this probably give good reason why traditionally ha been so negative with regard to sexuality it seems to tend to a great moral pornography would not tend in those direction if there were not a demand for many people have violent

kind of issue to deal with here the question is what is the point and it ha been quoted me often enough by those who believe i take it that jesus said to you love you will obey my i like any the slave of and it is my will that i should do a he will me to i am or his younger but still under his though we both call god will try to find what it is that their lord command and discovering it will feel obligated to do or to confess their reader here may set aside the theologizing jargon a of the point is that adherent of a religion read the text classified a or that are held up a in an effort to find application to their own this practice range from reading of sermon and the like to the exegesis of ical scripture a word of and at the highest this lead to a question of whether we find in inspired scripture something that can act a guidance for our the problem is in finding out just it is our lord i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christian have looked for these namely christian that is not because reject but because my primary audience in this essay is who deny tradition a determinative in favor of the witness of the question i want to deal with what commandment can we find from our lord in and that turn out to be a hard if any of my protestant inquisitor would to turn the discussion to the authority of i can accomodate them unlike episcopalian admit claim from scripture reason and tradition on roughly equal earlier in john than my quote we read give you a new love one this is the only place in the nt where christian are given an explicit with the context commenting on it imperative mode pronouncement by at the same meal we since it is in but in the jesus this this is my matthew luke corinthian the mode is imperative and hence is a in case we have to that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciple because we judge the point in mentioning it the disciple by then mostly or entirely is that are expected to follow this a a commandment from our in the case of mention this is probably true of the evangelist implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these word operate to christian to the original command to his a a continuing commandment to the christian i am entirely comfortable with this but i point out that it is between u and the occasion on which jesus spoke the i take it a a clear at the very least the that christian are called to love one in command directed at the but i have to call attention to the the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of it statement to my own context a a of all reading of scripture ha to make such to get any sense out of the text this is a general problem in reading these text we cannot read them at all without our understanding of our native language in which we read the and without appreciation of the original context at the original when english misleads i am going to in what that we have the problem of how to read scripture under control i think this is but it will suffice for my current i will address only the issue that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a year old text from another world than the one we live question at that level only introduce more vations about the commandment issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the text a the original audience might have among the reason we have for seeing a a commandment merely an instruction by jesus to this disciple on that one and one linking it to the synoptic is that we have from about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate in matthew we have learnt how it wa must love your and hate your but i say to love your in the leviticus context quoted doe not say your it is merely the common human leviticus is at pain to say that the should extend to stranger amongst the people of in expanding on this same q go on to have jesus sinner love those who love all of this suggests say that the scope of the is not quite what jesus ha in in inference to generalizing the actual text to a command that is on and with object not limited to other trickier than the or institution of there is the case of the where mark the twelve are sent out to that the kingdom of heaven is close at the verb is imperative but the context is rather specific to the and there are further specifier in not turn your step to pagan and do not enter any samaritan the lukan parallel are even more specific to final journey to which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christian than the previous that prevented christian from making such an what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the nor the first two case i by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the paul seems to have felt obliged to that the kingdom of heaven is close at even to instruction to the to the to the end of the christian after him have also taken this a a in the sense of john do i i it is surely rather but you see how the ripple of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext christian infer a general applicable to from what is presented in the gospel a a specific i do not object to this kind of generalization but i that people who make it have an understanding that they are some considerable from what we actually in there are involved in this and are themselves scriptural people will do their best to their assumption by other reference to scripture which simply add more inference into the move on to the that we should love god with our whole heart and mind and this the synoptic of and it is not presented a a in our the context is controversy with the to cite matthew when the pharisee heard that he had silenced the sadducee they got together to disconcert one of them put a which is the greatest commandment of the it is by no mean obvious here i accept it a that answer is meant to be a commandment he is answering a polemic from his in cast the answer in a far more positive light a the in this version more important than any holocaust need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal forget the nazi for or luke is intermediate he ha a lawyer posing the question and get the good samarian parable for his pain luke the context here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing inference in account is this said a if it were obviously to be taken a a commandment binding on christian though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus think it to be the point is that our mental gear have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to by and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of use of the torah in the quite gospel and the application of such a context to the different context among the synoptics are it should be noted that only in luke do we get the of this command by the parable of the good we may look for an analogous in where give the a meaning of the law and the where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the a generation before if we make these association i think are entirely we are again indulging in the text do not support we the text a having this kind of current literary theory call this my discussion of why the to apply beyond the community of the and beyound the circle of christian applies again to buttress a conclusion that this the presentation not saying so a to few christian would disagree with my conclusion but i point out that they they on rather elaborate chain of reasoning that are simply not present in the the contextual problem keep coming more and more severely a we look at those saying of jesus that are not so universally taken by christian a and we get some really hard take mark is pretty man who divorce his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against luke except that matthew ha an escape clause in the case of this seems to be a rather clear or not we take and some to this take it but some at least in this is rather it is not a if jesus were not explicit about this he say nothing at all about some of the thing people gnash their teeth how is it if the command of christ are that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelist of the synoptic going to continue this into but this is enough to start the theme commandment in scripture is an exercise in our inference are informed by our that our own cultural i so identified a very few that are generally accepted by all christian and yet in some of the difficulty start to it is these difficulty i want to discus in my next essay on this the divorce commandment already strike at some of the i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandment to condemn spend any time at all writing nasty screed to or about the horror or viciousness of or demanding that u law refuse to allow or refuse place in their that is not to say that divorce enter into consideration in general it is most definitely a matter of in even the most church for a liberal episcopalian priest of my in a liberal ha recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a secular ceremony before a so that the ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing by official who would just a soon not take on this role of interpreting the

for material for the lunar and for the design and creation of scale model of lunar colony and the initial design ha an ssto scale model which will be able to lift hover and a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry and a which will traverse most of the simulated lunar each machinelet ha a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on a personal computer digitizes the image reducing picture content and doing to allow for minimal image to be sent to the operator for control and also return control the first machinelet to be set up will be the since model train with tv camera built in are almost item and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are the user will receive an image once every to second depending on the speed of their data link to an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take hover over the entire lunar landscape and some tank model will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped the entire initial will allow remote operator worldwide to receive minimal image while actually operating model for landing and traveling and doing the entire system is based on commercially available item and part that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer by taking a graphically oriented communication program and adding a screen and the necessary user interface can be provided in under man plan of the diaspar virtual reality network ha agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that diaspar is providing the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar diaspar in the electronic tank that can be modified and one ccd tv diaspar also agrees to provide for the lunar train diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communication package and modify it for control of the an initial with miniature shovel will be performed for a live and news conference on april the initial model will be put in a record will be started for historical it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or the lunar colony will be declared open for additional operation and a photographer will be present and the photograph taken will be converted to image for distribution to major online network and a press release will be issued calling for contribution of material and scale model for the simulated lunar a contest for new design and technique for working on the moon will then be university will be invited to the goal being to find instructor who wish to have class participation in various aspect of the lunar colony field trip to can be arranged and at that time the result of the class work will be added to the contributor will then be able to any contributed once they return to their a monthly newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional mean to the any major new equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news having a real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television especially since the will be controlled by people all over the science fiction writer will be invited to issue to engineering and human factor student at university to build and operate the equipment to perform lunar using and pulley gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction the long term goal is creating experimentation and remote operation of a lunar ha the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activity and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limited to space all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the edutainment is the blending of education and anyone who ha ever enjoyed seeing miniature will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for education and experimentation by creating a model lunar colony we not only create but also a method of trying new idea that require real skill and open a new method for putting mind in the path of knowledge about space and lunar the following people are already engaged in various part of this the

western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persian from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great the persian were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institution a even if hypothesis have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period we must still maintain that they were of median this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the mentioned by darius i in the inscription at bisutun a well a by greek herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persian through the conspiracy of the the fact that the magi may have been member of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal art in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular this seems to be attested by the elamite tablet at there is a put forth by giuseppe that denies that the magi are member of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply member of the priesthood a priesthood of purely zoroastrian this thesis is on the other the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term derived from the gathic maga is not without foundation the meaning of maga can probably be in conformity with the pahlavi within the context of the concept of or separation of the of the two opposed principle of spirit and the which ha been erroneously interpreted a from the root which is said to mean the magic and ha been rendered simply by an expression like unio seems to be an ecstatic condition that open the mind to spiritual in any though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan the avesta ignores the median or old persian despite a recent hypothesis proposed by old persian inscription ignore the avestan term for athravan even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablet of persepolis the term magu ha been present in zoroastrianism throughout it the pahlavi term and mobad represent it the latter in particular derives from an older magupati of the during the sasanid period to seventh century which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized the title mobadan mobad high priest of high came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical the magi practiced consanguineous or khvaetvadatha they also performed a characteristic funeral the exposure of the corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse the corpse wa not supposed to lest it be contaminated by the demon of this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsi in stone known a were built especially for this during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse wa in vogue only among the the persian generally sprinkled the corpse with then buried the practice wa among the people of central the magi were the technician of and expert on it wa impossible to offer sacrifice without the presence of a during the performance of a ritual the magus sang of the theogony magi were possibly the custodian of a tradition of sacred but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various part of the and wa called upon to interpret dream and to divine the the magi were also known for the practice of killing or animal such a snake and they dressed in the median wearing and coat with they wore a characteristic head covering of felt with strip on the side that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during ritual to avoid contaminating consecrated object with their breath the color of these in conformity with a tradition that is probably of according to george wa that of the in all during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of a body of and it is probable that they gradually adopted they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priest who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and they must have been jealous guardian of the patrimony of zorastrian by virtue of this they were the educator of the royal the wisest of them wa responsible for teaching the prince the of son of and thus the of the magi who excelled in other virtue were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be and master of during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of great although they were certainly subordinate to the despite several dramatic event such a the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian in according to herodotus call himself the persian killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in in and in the various region of the empire where they were stationed a a consequence of the persian civilian and military no priesthood of antiquity wa more famous than that of the they were renowned a follower of zarathushtra a the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker a the wise men who guided by a at the manger of the newborn savior in and a the propagator of a cult of the sun in but they were also known a the the priesthood of known for it this wa perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in like in the magic and the chaldean were expert in all type of magical especially and had a reputation for wisdom a well a to understand the reason for such various and sometimes discordant it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the western who were later in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part but the western magi of the iranian diaspora in asia and who came in contact with diverse religious must sooner or later and in varying been influenced by syncretic the greek were familiar with both kind of magi depending on their varying would emphasize one or the other aspect of classical historian and including herodotus and document their while the philosopher dwell above all on their belief in the magian cosmology and and their theology and those source most interested in the doctrine of the magi even speak of zarathushtra a a in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid when they adopted at that time they embraced zarathushtra a one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformation in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and wa already adapting those element of the archaic religion that refused to it ha been said quite in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian that the vendidad part of the should be attributed to collection of text from various period is primarily concerned with purificatory rule and the hypothesis is hardly since the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen land created by ahura the supreme god of but contaminated by an attack by ahriman angra the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering doe not mention western or medium land of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median it ha been noted that if the author had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian including their own would be very the magi were above all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to from the second half of the first millennium bce this ha been their principal we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism known to u especially from greek source in from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth century according to this the two pole of the dualism are no a in the spenta mainyu and angra mainyu but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu ahura mazda and angra this formation wa of immense consequence for the historical development of astrianism and wa most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious in this new dualism which wa that later known to the greek eudemus of and we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within to which we give the name thanks to their adherence to the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of a well a in the definition of the new form that these would assume their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian idea in the community of the iranian the greek began to study their doctrine and to take an interest in them of even writing treatise on the persian of which only the title and a few fragment have in the hellenistic the magi were seen a a secular school of and writing on and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious name a and forming an abundant

to redeem the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notion of together with that of it appears a early a in the zarathushtra a the prophet of the is himself a one who performs his

       " 'reply brigham young university robert wei anderson replied to my letter in article just on something that you mentioned in you refer to differing interpretation of and say that many christian may not so that is really we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or do the bottom line is regardless of popularity of it may be to you and personal belief should i say but it is relevant to me and many bottom line is independant from you or anyone since you proclaim a a may i ask you by what authority you do because say so in the the bible or is it or someone who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or excuse but your line of moved me one bit to persuade me that my belief are of all the of on this you have struck me a a member of the wrecking with no positive message to me or any other this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the thing said by jesus to the ye preach about me with your but your heart are far removed from i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are you say the mormon you grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been in order to reply to the you have to address and answer the point that wa and not just jump to the conclusion that you look to you do that all you address is your own regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of because you reject such interpretation without any consideration the bible state that lucifer wa the bible state that jesus is the creator of the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds the former kgb would have loved to employ jesus and lucifer are not and you know the mormon belief is that all are child of there is nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible the bible teach that not everyone is a child of it may contradict would you think the bible the bible indeed doe teach that not all are child of god in the sense that they or follow god in his satan and his follower have rebelled against and are not of but it mean that they were not once created by but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of the field is the the good seed are the child of the but the tare are the child of the wicked illustrates nicely what i just the child of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus have shown of and the child of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the the issue of of those who followed ha not been addressed in this and other verse you copied from your you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your with related of nice scripture deleted robert we are told this is life that they might know thee the only true and jesus whom thou hast life eternal is to know the only true yet the doctrine of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly different a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of the they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim jesus is indeed different than your and can be reconciled with the jesus in the your interpretation of i but i honestly care one a being true denies the other from being according to the eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true and not the construct of in this single posting of seen more of than in all of the mail combined i have read so far in this news first get your straight before you dare preaching to u about only true whom you interpret according to your own like and but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about him i guess your grandiose doe not allow for other believing in the divinity of jesus but in a different way or fashion than your not that it really the mission and progress of the lds church will go boldly and and no mob or opponent can stop the work from until it ha visited every swept every and sounded in every this is really a red it address any issue but it seek to the fact that some group try to read something into the change what the bible the bible the bible teach according to robert wei and i respect the i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected on the and by the i do respect your interpretation of the i even grant you being a christian your own image of a much a i am a christian my own image of him in my most of the other reply have instead to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his view were i think that it matter if view were that is not the were writing indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real the indication from rick is that they may certainly the issue of that you love to use anything to either represent or ridicule the lds the issue of is obviously very view have been controversial seven deadly ha made me a at or erroneous at worst not to receive the priesthood in this i respect him a someone who ha made his valuable contribution to the but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretation book is oftentimes referred to a in mormon on mormon i rather look to official to hugh

what you say i understand you all the one asks what the other one usually but sometimes you and i ask you what you other time you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that debating against line sometimes i get and sometimes i have other thing rather this is and life is tough all going to have to deal with starting to get personally i may not even put your name in the hat in supposed to be a a simple and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless for those who accuse me of lying about my personal while also complaining that i answer their that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be only everything would be so almost everyone sens is evidence for the sensed to be to all intent and it had that for your claim that everyone sens it not and you have been asked to give evidence for it the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it there unless evidence against it ha been i have no problem with the second i have provided an argument that almost everyone sens that freedom is valuable the only cogent objection to this came from jon and wa offered by some other people that people disagree about fuzzy concept such a a good and thinking about trick is to i feel a is not and so do many i a is absolutely it neglect the possibility that people consider a to be right a an effect of the same the claim of it absoluteness to those who have been subject that in other refutes you make the ontological you have to prove my is to i feel that a is better than b and so doe almost any disinterested person i best evidence is therefore that a really is better than subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and and that the resulting system of value is now get is is an a fictional in the same sense that material is a fictional it may or may not correspond to something it is nonetheless a useful far more useful than the equally assumed relativist to i feel that a is better than and so doe almost any disinterested person i if even one person disagrees that a is better than or if even one person dissent from mutually agreed definition of a and then it is the case that b is better than a for that and nothing more can be i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b a to do that would be to claim that a carefully considered morality would be better than the which of be but a for an ethical to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of a similar i sense morality is it doe not me to do thing that are considered to be objectively wrong by you mean that you do thing that some others consider objectively and it turn out not to be the case for you of course this it is neither evidence for nor evidence objectivism in a pragmatic serf a a counterexample for that everything that is subject to is and a long a you provide evidence for there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to your done with the proviso that i still have to answer objection that fuzzy concept like freedom have no objective in order to make morality or would have to show that it is independent of or the attribute look quite not what evidence is there that exists independently of be hard pressed to find any that logically equivalent when applied to analogous set of premise would some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the and down the malahide i checked it and found that the shortest route from my which is much would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my to a yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist premise which are logically no moral are a matter of belief so the people still believe that the way is through the main no agreement on in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it the shortest way in other your analogy work only when assumes that your premise are right in the first if it is and if this were an argument for be it a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument nor argument your gimmick is to assume in the first

and use so say much about you only buy the package your particular call each utility is controlled by from one to eight read from a common which must be vms in your some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameter for a lengthy or difficult series of utility vms i can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language program which can interface with the pci data structure parameter the pci software is designed specifically for but requires such a level of operator expertise once you reach the level where you can handle you can figure out way to handle a few other thing a for the tape package offer a utility for reading headerless adobe photoshop on the macintosh call data from in a number of different this turn out to be ideal for manipulating the would probably handle and so above you have to know what doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start

       " 'gamma correction labtam australia australia here is a faq contribution on in article can someone who know what talking about add a faq entry on gamma i get regular question about gamma correction since i go to great pain to deal with it properly in xli image loader program i here is an explanation i often use to answer these this might be suitable for inclusion in the graeme note on gamma correction and graeme gill is all this gamma stuff anyway although it would be nice to think that image is an there are a lot of not only are there a whole bunch of different image format tiff etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that make dealing with image a bit gamma is one of those if ever downloaded image from bb or the probably noticed most image viewing that some image look some look too and some look too is this you may is gamma correction the lack of why do we need gamma correction at all gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crt ray tube the monitor usually used for viewing if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the then you have created a or this is a good thing in many way because you can manipulate the image a if the value in the image file were light adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a you find that the crt give you an amount of light proportional to the the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like voltage so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a the image will look much too to fix this up you have to the image you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the so that thing cancel and you get what you so you have to do this to your image for most the is somewhere between and if that is all it why doe it seem so complicated the problem is that not all display program do gamma also not all source of image give you linear image camera or video signal in because of a lot of image already have some gamma correction done to and you are rarely sure how if you try and display one of those image with a program that doe gamma correction for the image get corrected twice and look way to if you display one of those image with a program that do gamma then it will look vaguely but not because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular whose fault is all this it is really three one is all those display program out there that do gamma correction another is that most image format specify a standard or have some way or recording what their gamma correction the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all and create a lot of image with varying at least two file format do the right the utah graphic toolkit format ha a way of recording the gamma of an the jfif file standard us jpeg specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of a linear image but not everyone obeys the some image loader instance xli an image allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are but the individual gamma value of image you are trying to other image viewer xv another image and utility the pbm provide way of changing the gamma of an but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt note that xv provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an you need to adjust the g and b curve to the appropriate gamma in the coledit altering the intensity in the hsv control do the right a it fails to take account of the effect gamma ha on h and this tends to give a tint to the how can i figure out what my viewer or what gamma my screen ha the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file with xli which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale the ramp are chosen to look linear to the human one using continuous and the other using if your viewer doe the right thing and gamma corrects then the two ramp should look and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the find this point it help if you move away a little from the and your eye a if your viewer do gamma then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white and the point of equal brightness will be above the if your viewer doe have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the and decrease it if it is below the the value will usually be around xli for you can adjust the display gamma with the and once got it you can set the environment variable in your how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is this is the most tricky a a general rule it seems that a lot of true color image have a gamma of although there are many about that have some gamma it seems that the majority of pseudo color image bit image with color map are gamma corrected to some degree or if your viewer doe gamma correction then linear image will look and gamma corrected image will look too if your viewer do gamma then linear image will look too and gamma corrected image will why linear image are sometimes not such a good thing one of the reason that many high quality format a use gamma correction is that it actually make better use of the storage this is because the human eye ha a logarithmic response to and gamma correction ha a similar compression this mean image could make better use of bit per color if they used gamma the implication is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the bit image to or so linear bit to retain the same since little popular software doe and none of the popular image format can agree on a standard gamma correction it is difficult to justify gamma corrected image at the popular if some image format can standardize on a particular and if image manipulation software take care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal then gamma corrected distribution of image would be a good am told that the kodak photocd format for ha a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bit used to hold the',\n",

of cell in image projected by video camera attached to or enhancing and measuring distance in image analyst provides user with an array of video analysis technique that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instruction to enhance feature count determine or perform object feature and conduct textural analysis image analyst work with either a framegrabber board and any standard video or a within without the need for the image analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a measurement and statistic can be automatically or generated from tiff or pict file or from captured video tape image analyst recognizes item in image based on their shape and the tool provides direct support for the data translation and scion frame a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr video camera or other ntsc or pal there are type of the image itself and the related sequence file that hold the measurement and analysis that the user automated sequence are set up

case for there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any such thing a a alterian a a on the ground that is when we have a partition like we dismiss hypothesis to we also find no evidence to support that on the same ground a we dismiss hypothesis the problem with this is that we have dismissed of the possible and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every we have proven that it because we have dismissed all of it potential an poor and premise money is being paid to you by your hearted alterian or a bug in an alterian thus each monthly appearance of the should it is an observation on and by is evidence for the existence of the benefactor or the bug in the premise no observation on alterius are for the bank you possibly afford it you forgot to include my premise is premise the cardinality of the set of possible observation on alterius is this is clearly contradictory to the not if you state it trouble on the basis of premise you say that there can be no evidence of the benefactor or the but the first premise lead to the conclusion that the appearance of the should it is evidence for the existence of the benefactor or the a screaming my highlight but in a strawman there is only evidence for no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is that is not evidence for and neither is it evidence for nor is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly a if there were no both would be is still it reduces to alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to or this is not evidence for neither is it evidence for that it lend more weight to one than to the therefore no evidence can exist for and no evidence can exist for relies on a shift in meaning from when you say that this is not for for what you is that no evidence for than it is for what i shifted the meaning of for that it now mean for rather than for not i meant evidence that would tend to one over the i think this is just a communication what i am trying to in my clumsy is that while i buy your theory a far a it relates to theism making prediction your i buy your use of razor in all case where in my one dismiss or on the ground of simplicity one of these is necessary to explain the i brought up the process to show that it would be wrong to do from what saying in this it seems you and talking at is still in contradiction to sum may with b b d dosh arrives in implies that so either the benefactor a bug is responsible if the buck but not then implies that and this what i and with necessarily no new observation already seen the to change those i wa trying to say in my clumsy that it would be to assign probability to either of and precisely what use of the razor doe in the case of god god are one class of hypothesis are many belonging to a set of hypothesis is necessary to explain something which otherwise would be satisfactorily it can be thrown out or retained on ground of not of science or one could chuck out or retain the on the ground that the answer be or that the notional probability estimate are effectively being equal a they do when the set m is filled by universe is caused by where x is pink and no observation tends to one conclusion over the the point i wa i so we any of contrary to your assertion above that we some people and they think they are doing excellent my sole point wa that they only observation which directly contradict the hypothesis x where can cause to go to zero after a finite number of only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypothesis exactly my though i may have been said the diametric which i guess is the source of my i wa merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing what trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of this doe not hold true for or perhaps version of theism and it true that those for which it doe not hold can be discarded using the the those for which it doe not hold are those which be discarded using the see my post on the other branch of this then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me if the razor hold for then it hold for all like which mean that assigning for all though already established

said a much on numerous you be constructing a strawman would you that of rule out my being barking mad in any case could be barking mad in my spare with apology to cleese et i think you miss the point

launched pioneer a jupiter interest wa shifting to four of the outer planet uranus and neptune giant ball of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial world we had already four nasa spacecraft in all two pioneer and two voyager were sent in the to tour the outer region of our solar because of the distance these traveler took anywhere from month to year to reach their barring faster they will eventually become the first human artifact to journey to distant because the light becomes so faint in the outer solar these traveler do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbor mar and venus in the middle and late twin viking lander were equipped to serve a seismic

kilometer of the solar innermost planet on march until mariner little wa known about even the best telescopic view from earth showed mercury a an indistinct object lacking any surface the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar when the planet is visible on horizon just after sunset or before it is obscured by the haze and dust in our only radar telescope gave any hint of

dusty surface of our lifeless in preparation for the apollo nasa dispatched the automated surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between and apollo program left a large legacy of lunar material and six crew landed on and explored the lunar surface between and carrying back a collection of rock and soil weighing a total of kilogram and consisting of more than separate from this material and other scientist have constructed a history of the moon that includes it rock collected from the lunar highland date to about billion year the first few million year of the existence were so violent that few trace of this period a a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kind of the moon wa bombarded by huge asteroid and smaller some of the asteroid were a large a rhode island or and their collision with the moon created basin hundred of kilometer this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion year leaving the lunar highland covered with overlapping crater and a deep layer of shattered and broken heat produced by the decay of radioactive element began to melt the interior of the moon at depth of about kilometer below the for the next million year from about to billion year ago lava rose from inside the the lava gradually spread out over the flooding the large impact basin to form the dark area that galileo an astronomer of the italian called meaning a far a we can there ha been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion since the lunar surface ha been altered only by by the atomic particle from the sun and by the rare impact of large meteorite and by spacecraft and if our astronaut had landed on the moon a billion year they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one thousand of year from the footstep left by the apollo crew will remain sharp and the origin of the moon is still a four theory attempt an the moon formed near earth a a separate it wa torn from it formed somewhere else and wa captured by our or it wa the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of the last theory ha some good support but is far from mar of all the mar ha long been considered the solar prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial astronomer studying the red planet through telescope saw what appeared to be straight line crisscrossing it these observation later determined to be optical illusion led to the popular notion that intelligent being had constructed a system of irrigation canal on the in when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the world by enough people believed in the tale of invading martian to cause a near another reason for scientist to expect life on mar had to do with the apparent seasonal color change on the this phenomenon led to speculation that condition might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer month and cause plant life to become dormant during colder so six american mission to mar have been carried four mariner spacecraft three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiter and lander mariner launched in late flew past mar on july coming within kilometer of the transmitting to earth picture of the the spacecraft found many crater and naturally occurring channel but no evidence of artificial canal or flowing mariner and followed with their flybys during the summer of and returned mariner and showed a diversity of surface condition a well a a dry atmosphere of carbon on may the mariner orbiter wa launched on a mission to make a study of the martian the spacecraft arrived five and a half month after only to find mar in the midst of a dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several but after the storm mariner began returning the first of these revealed previously unknown martian including evidence that large amount of water once flowed across the etching river valley and flood in august and september the viking and spacecraft each consisting of an orbiter and a lander lifted off from kennedy space the mission wa designed to answer several question about the red is there life nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian but it wa hoped that the biology experiment on the viking lander would at least find evidence of primitive life past or viking lander became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july while the united state wa celebrating it photo sent back from the chryse planitia of showed a panoramic image returned by the lander revealed a rolling littered with rock and marked by rippled sand fine red dust from the martian soil give the sky a salmon when viking lander touched down on utopia planitia on september it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by it predecessor one without visible the result sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were small sample of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiment designed to detect biological while some of the test result seemed to indicate biological later analysis confirmed that this activity wa inorganic in nature and related to the soil is there life on no one know for but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecule exist the viking lander became weather recording wind velocity and direction a well a atmospheric temperature and few weather change were the highest temperature recorded by either craft wa degree celsius degree at the viking lander site in the lowest degree celsius degree wa recorded at the more northerly viking lander site during wind speed were measured at the two martian weather station during global dust but because the atmosphere is so wind force is viking lander photographed light patch of frost probably during it second winter on the the martian like that of is primarily carbon nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small martian air contains only about a much water a our but even this small amount can condense forming cloud that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slope of towering local patch of early morning fog can form in there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the physical feature closely resembling riverbed and island suggest that great river once marked the mar ha two phobos and they are small and irregularly shaped and posse cratered it is possible the moon were originally asteroid that ventured too close to mar and were captured by it the viking orbiter and lander exceeded by large margin their design lifetime of and the first to fail wa viking orbiter which stopped operating on july when a leak depleted it viking lander operated until april when it wa shut down because of battery viking orbiter quit on august when the last of it gas wa used viking lander ceased functioning on november despite the inconclusive result of the viking biology we know more about mar than any other planet except mar observer to be launched in september will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red asteroid the solar system ha a large number of rocky and metallic object that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered these object are known a asteroid or minor but not are found in a band or belt between the orbit of mar and some have orbit that cross and there is evidence that earth ha been hit by asteroid in the one of the least best preserved example is the barringer meteor crater near asteroid are material left over from the formation of the solar one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that wa destroyed in a massive collision long more asteroid are material that never coalesced into a in if the estimated total mass of all asteroid wa gathered into a single the object would be only about kilometer across le than half the diameter of our thousand of asteroid have been identified from it is estimated that are bright enough to eventually be photographed through much of our understanding about asteroid come from examining piece of space debris that fall to the surface of asteroid that are on a collision course with earth are called when a meteoroid strike our atmosphere at high friction cause this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known a a if the meteoroid doe not burn up left strike surface and is called a one of the best place to look for meteorite is the ice cap of of all the meteorite percent are composed of silicate and percent are composed of iron and the rest are a mixture of the three stony meteorite are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial since asteroid are material from the very early solar scientist are interested in their spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroid are separated by very large current and future mission will fly by selected asteroid for closer the galileo launched by nasa in october will investigate asteroid on it way to the comet flyby and cassini mission will also study these scheduled for launch in the latter part of the the craf and cassini mission are a collaborative project of the european space agency and the federal space agency of germany and a well a the united state air force and the department of one space factory will mine the asteroid for raw jupiter beyond mar and the asteroid in the outer region of our solar lie the giant planet of uranus and in nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial survey of these colossal world of gas and their moon of ice and jupiter wa the first port of pioneer which lifted off from kennedy space center in march wa the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer region of the solar in december it returned the first image of flying within kilometer of the banded cloud pioneer followed a year voyager and were launched in the summer of and returned spectacular photograph of jupiter and it family of satellite during flybys in these traveler found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and ammonia ice crystal form white jovian sulfur compound perhaps may produce the brown and orange hue that characterize it is likely that water and other gas react to form organic molecule in the region between the frigid cloud top and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying because of atmospheric these organic compound if they exist are probably the great red spot ha been observed for century through telescope on this storm in atmosphere is more than twice the size of our a a the great red spot spin in a direction opposite to that of storm on it is surrounded by swirling current that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by the great red spot might be a million year our spacecraft detected lightning in upper atmosphere and observed auroral emission similar to northern light at the jovian polar voyager returned the first image of a narrow ring encircling largest of the solar jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace once every hour minute the massive planet take almost earth year to complete a journey around the with known jupiter is something of a miniature solar a new mission to jupiter the galileo project is under after a year cruise that take the galileo orbiter once past twice past earth and the moon and once past two the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into cloud layer and relay data back to the galileo orbiter will spend two year circling the planet and flying close to large exploring in detail what the two pioneer and two voyager galilean satellite in galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four point of light orbiting the for the first human had seen the moon of another in honor of their these four body would become known a the galilean satellite or but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photograph returned by the voyager spacecraft a they flew past these one of the most remarkable finding of the voyager mission wa the presence of active volcano on the galilean moon volcanic eruption had never before been observed on a world other than the voyager camera identified at least nine active volcano on with plume of ejected material extending a far a kilometer above the marked by orange and yellow is probably the result of material brought to the surface by volcanic volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational between jupiter and the other three galilean approximately the same size a our is the brightest galilean the surface display a complex array of indicating the crust ha been caught in a gravitational like europa ha been heated enough to cause it interior ice to melt apparently producing a this ocean is covered by an ice crust that ha formed where water is exposed to the cold of core is made of rock that sank to it like the other two galilean moon ganymede and callisto are world of ice and ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planet mercury and the satellite is composed of about percent water or ice and the rest surface ha area of different indicating in the material oozed out of the interior and wa deposited at various location on the only slightly smaller than ha the lowest density of any galilean suggesting that large amount of water are part of it callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar no activity during it history ha erased old crater except more detailed study of all the galilean satellite will be performed by the galileo saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like it exquisite ring system is like saturn is composed mostly of but in contrast to the vivid color and wild turbulence found in jovian atmosphere ha a more butterscotch and it marking are muted by given somewhat scientist were surprised at the equatorial jet stream that blow some kilometer per three american spacecraft have visited pioneer sped by the planet and it moon titan in september returning the first voyager followed in november sending back breathtaking photograph that revealed for the first time the complexity of ring system and voyager flew by the planet and it moon in august the ring are composed of countless particle orbiting individually around equator at progressive distance from the cloud analysis of spacecraft radio wave passing through the ring showed that the particle vary widely in ranging from dust to the ring are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted the ring might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal force on it surface and in it or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of a third possibility is that the object wa shattered by collision with larger object orbiting the unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each individual ring particle appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and it these complex gravitational interaction form the thousand of ringlet that make up the major radio emission quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager these emission are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from ring system rather than it where no lightning wa a they had at the voyager saw a version of aurora near the voyager discovered new moon and found several satellite that share the same we learned that some moon shepherd ring maintaining ring and the gap in the moon wa discovered in from image taken by voyager in voyager determined that titan ha a atmosphere with methane and argon one more like in composition than the carbon dioxide atmosphere of mar and surface temperature of degree celsius degree implies that there might be island rising above ocean of liquid or camera could not penetrate the dense continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting methane to acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen the latter compound is a building block of amino these condition may be similar to the atmospheric condition of primeval earth between three and four billion year atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called which will be dropped into atmosphere and fall to the cassini will use the probe a well a radar to peer through cloud and will spend year examining the saturnian uranus in january four and a half year after visiting voyager completed the first survey of the uranian the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and it retinue of icy moon than had been gleaned from ground observation since the discovery over two century ago by the english astronomer william third largest of the is an oddball of the solar unlike the other planet the exception of this giant lie tipped on it side with it north and south pole alternately facing the sun during an swing around the solar during voyager the south pole faced the uranus might have been knocked over when an object collided with it early in the life of the solar voyager found that magnetic field doe not follow the usual axis found on the other the field is tilted degree and offset from the a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of on the island of java in atmosphere consists mainly of with some percent helium and small amount of methane and water the blue color occurs because methane in it atmosphere absorbs all other wind speed range up to kilometer per and temperature near the cloud top average degree celsius degree sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical believed to be a combination of ethane and other surrounding the atmosphere and extending thousand of kilometer into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known a approximately kilometer below cloud there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some kilometer beneath this ocean is an core of heavier voyager discovered new kilometer in orbiting the five previously known titania and oberon range in size from to kilometer to representing a geological these five moon are sphere that are cold and dark and show evidence of past including faulting and ice the most remarkable of moon is it surface feature high cliff a well a plain and winding the sharp variation in terrain suggest after the moon it wa smashed apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar which contains many object that have impact crater or are fragment from large what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in it interior exposed on it uranus wa thought to have nine dark voyager imaged in contrast to which are composed of bright ring are primarily made up of neptune voyager completed it tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the on august the spacecraft swept to within kilometer of neptune and then flew on to the moon during the neptune encounter it became clear that the atmosphere wa more active than voyager observed the great dark a circular storm the size of in resembling great red the storm spin counterclockwise and move westward at almost kilometer per voyager also noted a smaller dark spot and a cloud dubbed the a well a cloud over the main hydrogen and helium cloud the highest wind speed of any planet were up to kilometer per like the other giant neptune ha a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid the core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas distinctive blue like blue is due to atmospheric magnetic field is tilted relative to the spin axis and is not centered at the this phenomenon is similar to magnetic field and suggests that the field of the two giant are being generated in an area above the where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical property of a magnetic on the other is produced by it spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to it voyager also shed light on the mystery of observation from earth indicated that there were arc of material in orbit around the giant it wa not clear how neptune could have arc and how these could be kept from spreading out into unclumped voyager detected these but they in part of complete a number of small moon could explain the but such body were not astronomer had identified the neptunian moon triton in and nereid in voyager found six one of the new moon proteus is actually larger than but since proteus orbit close to it wa lost in the glare for observer on triton circle neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six tidal force on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the in to million year short time in astronomical the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it forming a spectacular ring to accompany the modest current landscape is a strange and unexpected a those of io and the moon ha more rock than it counterpart at saturn and mantle is probably composed of but the crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and the moon show two dramatically different type of the terrain and a receding ice dark streak appear on the ice these streak are the fallout from volcanic vent that shoot nitrogen gas and particle to height of to kilometer to thin only a thick a ha wind that carry the dark particle and deposit them a streak on the ice cap the coldest surface yet found in the solar system degree degree triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far pluto pluto is the most distant of the yet the eccentricity of it orbit periodically carry it inside where it ha been since and where it will remain until march orbit is also highly inclined tilted degree to the orbital plane of the other discovered in pluto appears to be little more than a celestial the diameter is calculated to be approximately kilometer only the size of our observation indicate that surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface a the planet move away from the observation also show that spin axis is tipped by the planet ha one known discovered in surface composition is different from the moon appears to be covered with rather than methane it orbit is gravitationally locked with so both body always keep the same hemisphere facing each and rotational period and period of revolution are all earth although no spacecraft have ever visited nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a comet the outermost member of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner a asteroid are the rocky and metallic remnant of the formation of the solar comet are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the most comet nucleus reside in the oort a loose swarm of object in a halo beyond the planet and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest comet nucleus orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbit that carry them close to the a a nucleus fall inside the orbit of the outer the volatile element of which it is made gradually by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner these volatile element are the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few mile and is made principally of with methane and ammonia material very similar to those composing the moon of the giant a these material boil off of the they form a coma or that can measure ten of thousand of kilometer the coma grows a the comet get closer to the the stream of charged particle coming from the sun push on this blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the gas and ion are blown directly back from the but dust particle are pushed more a the nucleus continues in it the dust particle are left behind in a curved both the gas and dust tail point away from the in the comet chase it tail a it recedes from the the tail can reach million kilometer million in but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary comet from the latin meaning are essentially dramatic light some comet pas through the solar system only but others have their orbit gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer these latter visitor can enter closed elliptical orbit and repeatedly return to the inner solar comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period returning on an average of once every year and orbiting from beyond neptune to within confirmed sighting of the comet go back to this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond because he plotted the orbit and predicted it based on earlier sighting and newtonian law of his name became part of astronomical lore in the comet returned on sir edmond did not live to see a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it pass comparatively close to on it most recent comet passed no closer than million kilometer million from our the comet wa visible to the naked especially for viewer in the southern but it wa not comet have been so on rare that they were visible during comet sighting have been interpreted a bad omen and have been artistically rendered a dagger in the the comet flyby spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it a they both approach the craf will observe the nucleus a it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begin to have it lighter element boil off and form a coma and several spacecraft have flown by comet at high the first wa international cometary explorer in an armada of five spacecraft two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space flew by comet in conclusion despite their effort to peer across the vast distance of space through an obscuring scientist of the past had only one body they could study closely but since spaceflight through the solar system ha lifted the veil on our neighbor in we have learned more about our solar system and it member than anyone had in the previous thousand of our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planet beyond our world except they have observed moon a large a small flown by comet and sampled the solar astronomy book now include detailed picture of body that were only smudge in the largest telescope for we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful place and the knowledge gained from our journey through the solar system ha redefined traditional earth science like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative by studying the geology of asteroid and and comparing difference and we are learning more about the origin and history of these body and the solar system a a we are also gaining insight into complex weather by seeing how weather is shaped on other world and by investigating the activity and it influence throughout the solar we can better understand climatic condition and process on we will continue to learn and benefit a our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in one current mission is mapping others are flying between world and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory future mission are planned for a comet and the asteroid we can also look forward to the time when human will once again set foot on an alien although astronaut have not been back to the moon since december plan are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mar and even the establishment of martian one taking a holiday

make the modification to the make because the main use of xv is only viewing many change to we should keep all modification a and then before making the operation to should simplify the operation list for unnecessary about what you are saying the bit image is quantised down to so many colour are mapped onto a single palette this get modified in fairly arbitrary you then want to apply these back to the bit so you have to find which mapped to this one palette suppose you know what about we have discussed about in xv which show image only a my suggestion above work perfectly with look be first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an bit program a some sort of so i post and asy it is not a it is meant to be like so you post and say it is not a you never said it i have misunderstood now you are discussed about in xv which show image only a if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that there be a colormap the problem you present are exist i tried to solve them at because i would not make such to my program in the first i understand what you are saying i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your but this paragraph defeat and color correction are easily done to image i no need make trick from image to bit yes i originally global change are easily but this statement contradicts what you said wrote something about making color modification quickly quantized image and only at the saving the image to file we have to make the modification to the would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit how you group colour to edit them only global could be done unless the software were very different and more writing about situation that user want edit image a user want edit individual color your by the off the discussion a no i think so you were talking about loading a bit image into xv manipulating the colour in the colour then somewhow applying these change to the bit file when you exit xv let you edit individual where is this sudden jumping off the solution because no colormap withing real yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a bit you user see going back to is i do not understand what this statement is supposed to changing individual color in individual color in colormap is useless in most if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may serious error to anywhere in the what are you saying allows this but i recommend to use it with the type now we see thew first you want to extend xv to allow editing of bit preview of bit then i point out problem with now you are saying there is no problem because happen not to use those part of the program that cause the xv is not a paint you can only make those global not sure what you are saying certainly one can make local full changing individual color sound like program person have need for trick to get the image because user see full need to make approximation and it is not possible to individual color but individual pixel or pixel group is to select indiavidual there could be window which show true color image in cursor window area individual color is possible from yes that is one possible i would find a program that took such an approach i have thought very much painting never seen in good view and are not planned to make not to mention painting program in well here we agree you have not thought it through very you seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the we all have off day perhaps you should step back and think this one what wrong with saved image a jpeg is not for a i said in the last jpeg is a compression it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against i fail to see what the problem you have not proposed any workable human expect that will be saved a speak for you are the person i have met or spoken to having quantised a bit image down to expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the bit image perhaps that is why you yused the would like to crop part of the image and save then it is that the image still is the next time you import a bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tell you how many colour have been allocated to the bit xv make it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original bit you are the person who claim this is xv were designed thinking about human interface and how human expect the work design is a design error the same a a read my xv is a program for viewing and modifying bit it let you import other it i would a good deal of thought about the human and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it wa designed it make no false have heard xv were designed first for but were not good idea to take full image without making change to the original if you would come up with a well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extension would feel free to post so you have not done even all screen image are the processed image and saved could have been very instead of after all a comment like go ahead and code it if it is so or look up the term and anybody will make a i may a well make a lift where mean that the lift go down and mean that the lift go and put a note on this design solution to

degraded ever we have some evidence in favour of this perhaps the biggest of the code is that it is full of which are so called because they intervene with the coding region an impressive amount of evidence suggests that intron are of very ancient it is likely that early exon represented early protein is the number of intron decreasing or it appears that intron loss can and specie with common ancestry usually have quite similar structure in their on the other the possibility that intron have been inserted present several logical intron are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be but if intron are intron insertion would have required targeting random insertion would not be since sequence for intron removal of are transposition of a sequence usually leaf a trace long terminal repeat and target site and these are not found in or near intron i seriously recommend reading textbook on molecular biology and genetics before posting like try molecular biology of the gene or lodish molecular biology of the cell for the question wa posed in a theological context doe god cause disease in and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my it is no le valid than a purely scientific just scientific perspective is supported by the whereas theological perspective often fail to fulfil this i think you misread my i said god made the genetic code but that mean perfect it ha certainly evolved for the would you please cite a few reference that support your your assertion is le valid than the scientific unless you support it by some in it ha been claimed that parasite and disease are perhaps more important than thought for sex might have evolved a defence against view is supported by computer simulation of eg i thought it wa higher energy ray like gamma and cosmic ray that caused most of the in it is thermal energy that doe most of the although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic neither of u what the atmosphere wa like at the time when god created according to my most biologist do not claim that life began billion year ago after that would only be a half billion year or so after the earth wa it would still be too primitive to support i seem to remember a figure more like to billion year ago for the origination of life on anyone with a better replace with since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without most recent estimate of the age of the earth range between billion and earliest sign of life true but date back to billion this would leave more than billion year for the first cell to sorry i give any this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended it wa no great feat for satan to genetically engineer both and although the force of selection tend to improve the survivability of the of the genetic code tends to more than offset do you this be or do you have any evidence for this supposed i can understand excuse but this is so that i know you must be do you know what pathogen do you know what point mutation do you know that everything can come about in response to your last and neither do you may very well believe that and accept it a but you cannot i hope you forget we have that suggests everything can come about do you have evidence against this in one doe not have to in it is a healthy sign to doubt and but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do and not to present own conclusion prior to theology doe not use this i seriously doubt it could ever come to right being more tends to accumulate error adversely our and ability to fight off while the dna of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in infection and it is a bad hence have newborn that suffer from and bacterial you are supposing a not a valid bacteria and virus do not exist to cause they are just another manifest of a general principle of evolution only replication save replicators from we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and the le efficient method make it to the and for the last please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our and thus are bound to i seen much evidence for either but then i where is this relevant to my discussion in answering question of why are there genetic and why are there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop is it original i say it is of nothing is but your explanation doe not it fails you may be but the fact is that you know that satan is not and neither do suppose that a evil being like satan would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect i think he could have done a much better the problem it seems no satan is necessary to explain any they are just a inevitable a any product of did i say seems to me like another bad actually what done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my word take on a new i never said that people are by be punished by getting why i did say is that free moral choice have attendent if mankind chooses to reject a people have done since the then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse event in an entropic i am not expecting if god i expect him to leave u i would also like to hear why do you believe your choice are indeed this is an interesting philosophical and the answer is not a a it seems to what consequence would you expect from rejecting i admit not perfect but working on a good library or a bookstore is a good starting what doe this have to do with the price of tea in or the question to which i provided an biology and genetics are fine subject and important scientific but they explain god created and set up life they explain the why behind or it subsequent why is there a and your proposition wa something that is not supported by the this is why we recommend these is there any need to invoke any why a prime evidence for if the whole universe can come into existence without any a recent cosmological theory et why do people still insist on thanks for your fine and sagely but i am not highly motivated to learn all the detail of biology and although sure find it a fascinating for i realize that the detail do not change the big that god created life in the beginning with the ability to

homophobe implication is it must necessarily follow that all men are latent homosexual or bisexual at the very crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of come from phobia an irrational fear hence a homophobe only in act up the word is apparently in general use or perhaps it in the wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in doe an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a doe an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open do you understand obviously someone who ha phobia will react to they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run or do gaybashings occur because of natural people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them that what i said what are you taking issue with your remark are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function than limiting population since evolution only occurs when the member of one generation pas along their trait to subsequent homosexuality is an evolutionary if i take your usage of the in the sense you seem to then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our specie at is going so time a man ha sex with a woman they intend to produce wonder the world is obviously you keep to the monty python sperm is and a it ha a purpose a a mean to limit population growth then it by your own consider the talking about an evolutionary one of the most basic requirement of evolution is that member of a specie those who have no purpose in that another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to the participation of both parent is necessary a family must since homosexual do not they cannot constitute a since the majority of humankind is part of a homosexuality is an evolutionary contrary to nature if you well if that is by your own arguements homosexual would have vanished ago due to also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold co they by your by your homosexuality is genetically a to your second you prove again that you have no idea what context i am talking about the preservation of the the fundamental premise of the whole but it get since the overwhelming majority of people actually a heterosexual homosexuality is a social abberation a the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social the but read the i expect you to have at least ten child by with the family these day sex is le to do with procreation without it there would be but more to do with in and if you had sex there wa the chance of producing these day is just people can decide whether or not to have child and soon they will be able to choose sex another so more of a again by your since homosexual can not choose to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not both are a a each yet another sex is an evolutionary function that exists for that it is also recreation is that homosexual procreate mean that sex is recreation and nothing they serve no since homosexual have come out the closet and have convinced some policy maker that they have civil they are now claiming that their sexuality is a a an a choice that should be protected by now if homosexuality is a mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and then it is a perverse they have even le credibility than before they became people are people are who are you to tell anyone else how to live their are you if fancy a pretty obvious do you really think said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every i am not telling anyone i am demonstrating that there are argument against the practice of homosexuality a merely an alternate that are not that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can i realize of course that this come dangerously close to establishing a and that atheist are compelled to object on that but if you are to be you have no case in this to characterize any opposition to homosexuality a homophobic is to ignore some very compelling argument against the legitimization of the homosexual but since the charge is only intended to really just demogoguery and not to be taken fact there are far more persuasive argument for suppressing homosexuality than those but consider this a again all your argument are based on outdated likewise the would any honest christian condemn the ten generation spawned by a to eternal or someone who crush his penis accidently or both are in sure your comment pertains to but disguised it so well i see where did i mention or your argument are very do you have anything at all to a to why homosexual should be excluded from participation in the reason are the same a those used to restrict them from by their own homosexual are social and since any adult is a role model for a it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child in this harm mean primarily though that could be extended easily you show me who ha sex in a way that everyone would describe a and

reply to the you have to address and answer the point that wa and not just jump to the conclusion that you look to you do that all you address is your own regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of because you reject such interpretation without any consideration the bible state that lucifer wa the bible state that jesus is the creator of the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds the former kgb would have loved to employ jesus and lucifer are not and you know the mormon belief is that all are child of there is nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible the bible teach that not everyone is a child of it may contradict would you think the bible the bible indeed doe teach that not all are child of god in the sense that they or follow god in his satan and his follower have rebelled against and are not of but it mean that they were not once created by but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of the field is the the good seed are the child of the but the tare are the child of the wicked illustrates nicely what i just the child of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus have shown of and the child of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the the issue of those who followed ha not been addressed in this and other verse you copied from your you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your with related of nice scripture deleted robert we are told this is life that they might know thee the only true and jesus whom thou hast life eternal is to know the only true yet the doctrine of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly different a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of the they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim jesus is indeed different than your and can be reconciled with the jesus in the your interpretation of i but i honestly care one a being true denies the other from being according to the eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true and not the construct of in this single posting of seen more of than in all of the mail combined i have read so far in this news first get your straight before you dare preaching to u about only true whom you interpret according to your own like and but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about him i guess your grandiose doe not allow for other believing in the divinity of

never mention he is mentioned by some greek source of the time by who seems unaware of the avesta doe not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of but the text is useful in an indirect a it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose wa not that of iran under the medes or the the greek on the other do provide some information

recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various it is generally although the historical value of the greek source is they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid a the above account would seem to they also show that by this time zarathushtra wa already seen a an almost mythical one

others believe that it is devoid of historical the most convincing seem to support the latter the figure of year is accurate only on the surface because it in the more general one of which wa employed by sasanid propagandist to locate lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian for a number of reason connected with complex problem inherent in the iranian there wa also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandist to avoid any millenarian in this whom tradition place early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the converted vishtaspa at the age of and conversion wa viewed by some a the beginning of the millennium explaining the double date of and year before given the unreliability of the few available we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few century before cyrus the and a there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievement that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium nor is there any mention of the history of that which wa to lead iran to a position of such at the same for a number of going back much further in history would not be the traditionally accepted theory of placing thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most a to land of many scholar on the basis of valid that he must have come from eastern some have held that he wa a largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with but also because of linguistic based on the language of the this should be a we can both on historical and linguistic that zarathushtra came from the even though we do not know precisely from which there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular including the improbable view that he came from or or from a wider chorasmian reaching a far a the oasis of merv and most land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain

earlier claim that the one innocent death override the benefit of all the obviously but it is no argument for doing away with the death if we went to war and worried about accidentally killing civilian all of the time our determination of who the enemy really is is then there is no way to win the fortunately we have folk like your good self in and it wa therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred of thousand of iraqi in order to liberate we won the hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death were way and exploited for emotionalism by the liberal news the fact are that le iraqi died in the gulf war than did civilian in any other war of comparable size this this wa due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing technique which were technically possible only the idea that of of iraqi citizen died is not even of of iraqi soldier and they were the one being or do you think that the u and it ally were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi either the smart bomb hit their target we know they or they were targeting civilian target which is hardly condusive to destroying military the military mission planner are not they know they have to hit target to win a hitting civilian target doe nothing but unite the people against not a laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their so some innocent people maybe the unarmed civilian fleeing along that road need to be bombed to perhaps that kid with half his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled leg entirely but worth the death of a few innocent to save the of the kuwaiti after the iraqi may not have had a chance to vote for but they showed their acceptance of his regime by not assassinating all that surrendering and fleeing along open road wa just a devious we were entirely within our right to bomb just in without finding out if they were how about all the innocent people who died in in i hear you bemoaning war is never an exact but with smart becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian sometimes mistake are target are innocent war the way it really but the to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like one big rummage grabbing everything they can get is like patrick henry said some year know not what course others may take but a for give me or give me war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay the death penalty wa conceived a a deterrent to but the legal shenanigan that have been added lengthy court have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should hence the question do we instate the death penalty a it wa meant to and see if that deters or do we get rid of it reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to all that shit about fair trial and a court of appeal just get in the way of give the police the absolute right to gun down the and save ourselves the expense of all those think of the la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after riot and holding showcase trial if the cop had been allowed to do their job a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the and everyone would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and after if the police decide a that ought to be the fact that the death penalty ha been shown not to have any deterrent effect over entirely mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely you come off sounding like a complete although i feel sure that wa not your so the iraqi war wa sure that appeasement would have worked better than just like it did in i guess we have fought either just think of all those innocent german civilian killed in dresden and how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the we should have just let hitler take over and be speaking german instead of english right tyrant like hussein to be his kind understand they only understand the point of a my only regret is that bush wimped out and have the military

got it when you stopped and made your point instead of that wa my point all only you do the same thing on the net reporting your idea matter of policy and project in but your response wa just not even part of a have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the true szabo i see him attacking calling them because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight i see him questioning people again because they had the to disagree with lord god but glad you can since your ratio of is about the even and generally only when dealing with like i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not suffice to say that i disagree with you

with the fact my conclusion wa that you were taking issue with is evidence that your communication style is evidence that your reading and comprehension style are i try to address what i think you for which i am rewarded with a denial of and a smart i point out that i am not clear what you did rather than risking your childish wrongly interpreting you a second and stupid for i just can got a great

proselytize on so when i talk of i am talking primarily about religion such a judaism and which involve some sort of superhuman divine much of the discussion will apply to other but some of it may is atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of some atheist go and believe that god doe not the former is often referred to a the and the latter a it is important to note the difference between these two is simple disbelief in the existence of is a positive belief that god doe not please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheist are some atheist believe in the of all others limit their atheism to specific such a the christian rather than making disbelieving in god the same thing a believing he definitely disbelief in a proposition mean that one doe not believe it to be not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is one may simply have no idea whether it is true or which brings u to is agnosticism the term wa coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in he defined an agnostic a someone who disclaimed atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and thus an agnostic is someone who belief that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god word are slippery and language is beware of assuming that you can work out philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an for many people use agnosticism to mean and use the word only when referring to beware also that because the word ha so many shade of it is very difficult to generalize about about all you can say for sure is that atheist believe in for it certainly the case that all atheist believe that science is the best way to find out about the what is the philosophical justification or basis for there are many philosophical justification for to find out why a particular person chooses to be an best to ask many atheist feel that the idea of god a presented by the major religion is essentially and that it is logically impossible that such a god could others are atheist through because they see no evidence that god it impossible to prove the of there are many to such a for it is quite simple to prove that there doe not exist a prime number larger than all other prime of this deal with object obeying whether god or universe are similarly is a matter for assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably there are still subtle reason for assuming the of if we assume that something doe not it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single if on the other hand we assume that something doe and if the thing in question is not provably showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be to show that it such an exhaustive search is often impractical or there is no such problem with largest because we can prove that they therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they even theist follow this rule most of the they believe in even though they conclusively prove that no unicorn exist to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he exist so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god doe not since that is an assumption we can those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god they generally restrict their claim so a to cover variety of god described by follower of various so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god it may be possible to prove that a god a described by a particular religious book doe not it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any religion in believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god it is sufficiently different that based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really what if god is essentially if god interacts with our universe in any the effect of his interaction must be hence his interaction with our universe must be if god is essentially it must therefore be the case that he doe not interact with our universe in any many atheist would argue that if god doe not interact with our universe at it is of no importance whether he exists or if the bible is to be god wa easily detectable by the surely he should still be detectable note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically physical it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his how can i distinguish him from all the other thing that you may think a philosophical justification for but it still a religious one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion is redefinition the cynical view of this game is a person a begin by making a contentious when person b point out that it be person a gradually the word he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to he then record the along with the fact that person b ha agreed to and eventually a us the statement a an but us his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally needed to get b to agree to rather than be seen to be apparently b will tend to play the point of this digression is that the answer to the question atheism a religious depends crucially upon what is meant by is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worth pointing out in passing that some variety of buddhism are not according to such a atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful widening the definition of to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed a a well such a and watching so not a but surely belief in atheism is still just an act of like religion not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually belief it is necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we most atheist try to adopt a few core belief a and even those are subject to questioning if experience throw them into science ha a number of core for it is generally assumed that the law of physic are the same for all these are the sort of core assumption atheist if such basic idea are called of then almost everything we know must be said to be based on act of and the term loses it faith is more often used to refer to certain belief in according to such a atheism and science are certainly not act of of individual atheist or scientist can be a dogmatic a religious follower when claiming that something is this is not a general there are many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or sceptical atheism certainly fit that a sceptical atheism ha no strong atheism is but still really a even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data the lack of when asserting that god doe not atheism is not surely it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone a either or or the truth is not so atheism is the position that run logically counter to in that it can be said to be when religious believer speak of atheist being they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards this categorization of atheist a hostile towards religion is quite atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad most atheist take a and let unless they will not usually mention their except perhaps to close of this may be in part because atheism is not in many a few atheist are quite and may even try to others when such atheist have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc digress the soviet union wa originally dedicated to separation of church and just like the soviet citizen were legally free to worship a they the institution of came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the some atheist are quite vocal about their but only where they see religion encroaching on matter which are not it business for the government of the such individual are usually concerned that church and state should remain if you allow religion to have a say in the running of the surely the same a state the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matter of religious in it mean not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular for religious believer have historically been responsible for encouraging many political even many organization campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded a religious so long a they campaign concerning secular and so long a they do not discriminate on religious most atheist are quite happy to see them have their about prayer in if no why do you care if people because people who do pray are voter and and tend to do thing that those who pray just christian prayer in school is intimidating to even if they are told that they need not join the diversity of religious and belief mean that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public tend to have friend and family who it is reasonable to care about friend and family wasting their even without other mentioned christian who campaign for increased foreign what about why there any atheist charity or atheist object to the religious there are many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute some atheist contribute to religious charity a for the sake of the practical good they some atheist even do voluntary work for charity founded on a theistic most atheist seem to feel that atheism worth shouting about in connection with to atheism is just a obvious everyday and so is many feel that somewhat not to say to use simple charity a an excuse to plug a particular set of religious to building a hospital to say do not believe in is a rather strange rather like holding a party to say is not my why the atheism is rarely said atheism but is it perhaps a backlash against a way of perhaps it for but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious idea upon and many of those people choose to call themselves also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion a a backlash against an atheist a a way of being on the other many people choose religion a a way of conforming to the expectation of on the we conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or although in people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think do atheist differ from religious they believe in all there is to atheist may listen to heavy metal even or they may prefer a verdi even if they know the they may wear hawaiian they may dress all in they may even wear orange buddhist lack a belief in any sort of some atheist even carry a copy of the bible around for arguing of whoever you the chance are you have met several atheist without realising atheist are usually unexceptional in behaviour and but atheist le moral than religious that if you define morality a obedience to then of course atheist are le moral a they obey any but usually when one talk of one talk of what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour within human are social and to be maximally successful they must with each this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from or purely for the purpose of many atheist behave in a or way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other so why do they care what happens to they they simply are that there are some people who behave and try to use atheism to justify their there are equally many people who behave and then try to use religious belief to justify their for is a trustworthy saying that deserves full jesus christ came into the world to save but for that very i wa shown mercy so that in jesus christ might display his unlimited patience a an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal now to the king the only be honor and glory forever and the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february by jeffrey the notorious cannibal serial killer of it seems that for every atheist there is a religious but what of more trivial a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after while only of respondent said they had driven intoxicated before being had done so after had used illegal drug before two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before september so it seems that at religion doe not have a monopoly on moral there such a thing a atheist if you mean there such a thing a morality for then the answer is a explained many atheist have idea about morality which are at least a strong a those held by religious if you mean atheism have a characteristic moral then the answer is atheism by itself doe not imply anything much about how a person will most atheist follow many of the same a but for different atheist view morality a something created by according to the way human feel the world to rather than seeing it a a set of rule decreed by a supernatural atheist just theist who are denying a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of the atheist who responded became atheist because religion did not work for they had found that religious belief were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around atheist are not unbeliever through ignorance or they are unbeliever through the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more sometimes in very great they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious this decision of be an inevitable consequence of that for a naturally sceptical the choice of atheism is often the only one that make and hence the only choice that person can honestly atheist want to believe in atheist live their life a though there is nobody watching over many of them have no desire to be watched no matter how the figure might some atheist would like to be able to believe in god but so should one believe thing merely because one want them to be the risk of such an approach should be atheist often decide that wanting to believe something is not there must be evidence for the of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their soul to if not most atheist were previously a ha been explained the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god many atheist have spent time in prayer trying to reach of it is true that some atheist lack an open but assuming that all atheist are biased and insincere is offensive and comment such a course god is you just looking are likely to be viewed a if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the debate is the whole of life completely pointless to an many atheist live a purposeful they decide what they think give meaning to and they pursue those they try to make their life not by wishing for eternal but by having an influence on other people who will live for an atheist may dedicate his life to political in the hope of leaving his mark on it is a natural human tendency to look for or in random it is by no mean obvious that is the sort of thing that ha a to put it another not everything which look like a question is actually a sensible thing to some atheist believe that asking is the meaning of is a silly a asking is the meaning of a cup of they believe that life ha no purpose or it just how do atheist find comfort in time of there are many way of obtaining from or even or on a le spiritual from food or drink or that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face but so should individual believe in thing because they are or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might in the a decision for the individual most atheist are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make them feel they put truth before and consider that if searching for truth sometimes make them feel just hard atheist worry that they might suddenly be shown to be the short answer is do many atheist have been atheist for they have encountered many argument and much supposed evidence for the existence of but they have found all of it to be invalid or thousand of year of religious belief resulted in any good proof of the existence of atheist therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate and they stop worrying about why should theist question their the same argument because the belief being questioned are not weak atheism is the sceptical to it asserts strong atheism is a negative theism is a very strong positive atheist sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the but to everyone sort of religion represents a huge financial and work burden on not just a matter of religious believer wasting their money on church think of all the time and effort spent building and so imagine how that effort could be better many theist believe in miracle there have been plenty of instance of ill people being by a ceasing to take the medicine prescribed to them by and dying a a some theist have died because they have refused blood transfusion on religious it is arguable that the catholic opposition to birth control and condom in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many country and contributing to the spread of aid religious believer have been known to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different real they just claimed to be believer a some sort of what make a real there are so many one true religion hard to look at there are many competing all convinced that they are the only true sometimes they even fight and kill each how is an atheist supposed to decide a real christian and who when even the major christian church like the catholic church and the church of england decide amongst in the most atheist take a pragmatic and decide that anyone who call himself a and us christian belief or dogma to justify his should be considered a maybe some of those christian are just perverting christian teaching for their own end but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support act it be much of a moral if the bible is the word of why he have made it le easy to and how do you know that your belief a perversion of what your god if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your but if someone claim that he belief in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do we must call him a those extreme sort of belief should be but since nobody ha ever proved that god doe not it must be very unlikely that more basic religious shared by all are that doe not because a wa pointed out at the start of this positive assertion concerning the existence of entity are inherently much harder to disprove than negative nobody ha ever proved that unicorn but that make it unlikely that they are it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by of atheist would argue that asserting nothing is better if so why are there so many the popularity of a belief ha little to do with how it or whether it consider how many people believe in and other many atheist feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in certainly in many primitive human religion allows the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately of more to religion than in the industrialized we find people believing in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there are perfectly adequate natural religion may have started a a mean of attempting to explain the but nowadays it serf other purpose a so many culture have developed surely that must say not most religion are only superficially for worth remembering that religion such a buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian of most religion are quick to denounce competing so rather odd to use one religion to try and justify about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have concluded that god for every scientist or philosopher who belief in a there is one who doe a ha already been pointed the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it is important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious a famous scientist is only she may be an expert in some but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special many respected scientist have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subject which lie outside their field of are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates not it certainly indicates that the religion in question ha property which have helped it so spread so the theory of memetics talk of set of idea which can propagate themselves between human by analogy with some atheist view religion a set of particularly successful parasitic which spread by encouraging their host to convert some meme avoid destruction by discouraging believer from questioning or by using peer pressure to keep believer from admitting that they were some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host controlled by other of in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught if religion is not entirely at least it put across important what are the fundamental message of there are many important idea atheist the following are just a few of be surprised to see idea which are also present in some there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following be especially sceptical of positive if you want your life to have some sort of up to you to find search for what is even if it make you make the most of your a probably the only one no good relying on some external power to change you must change just because popular mean if you must assume assume something easy to believe thing just because you want them to be and finally most all

photographic expert the original name of the committee that wrote the jpeg is designed for compressing either or digital image of it doe not work so well on such a cartoon or line jpeg doe not handle nor doe it handle motion picture standard for compressing those type of image are being worked on by other named jbig and mpeg jpeg is meaning that the image you get out of decompression quite identical to what you originally put the algorithm achieves much of it compression by exploiting known limitation of the human notably the fact that small color detail perceived a well a small detail of jpeg is intended for compressing image that will be looked at by if you plan to your the small error introduced by jpeg may be a problem for even if they are invisible to the a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image you can make small file if you mind poor this is useful for indexing image making thumbnail view or if you happy with the output quality at the default compression you can jack up the quality until you are and accept lesser why use there are two good to make your image file and to store color data instead of making image file smaller is a big win for transmitting file across network and for archiving library of being able to compress a mbyte file down to kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission you are comparing gif and the size ratio is more like four to more detail if your viewing software support jpeg have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating even with a it take longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format for using jpeg is essentially a you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more worth noting that when network or phone transmission is the time saving from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the let you do the arithmetic the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif a a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color million instead of or le or fewer if you have only display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to within a couple of gif will look a obsolete a macpaint format doe for reason detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging image among people with widely varying color display hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use a a usenet posting when should i use and when should i stick with jpeg is going to displace gif for some type of gif is superior in image file or one of the first thing to learn about jpeg is which kind of image to apply it a a rule of jpeg is superior to gif for storing or image of that mean scanned photograph and similar jpeg is superior even if you have display and it is a lot superior if you section for gif doe significantly better on image with only a few distinct such a cartoon and line in large area of pixel that are all the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by jpeg squeeze these file a much a gif doe without introducing visible this sort of image is best kept in gif border are quite cheap in gif but they should be avoided in jpeg jpeg also ha a hard time with very sharp a row of pixel adjacent to a row of for sharp edge tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality this sort of thing is not found in scanned but it show up fairly often in gif overlaid the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text only a few pixel if you have a gif with a lot of overlaid jpeg image for usually fall between scanned image and cartoon in term of the more complex and subtly rendered the the more likely that jpeg will do well on the same go for artwork drawing and plain image should never be converted to you need at least about gray level before jpeg is useful for it should also be noted that gif is lossless for image of up to while jpeg is if you have an existing library of gif you may wonder whether you should convert them to you will lose a little image quality if you which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to only applies if both format start from a if you start from a already irretrievably lost a great deal of jpeg can only make thing the disk space saving may justify converting this is a decision have to make for if you do convert a gif library to see section for be prepared to leave some image in gif since some gifs will not convert how well doe jpeg compress pretty darn here are some sample file size for an image i have a image of a ship in a the first three file are for comparison the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section file size in byte comment original file in ppm format bit or byte per plus a few byte ppm file passed through unix compress compress accomplish a other compressor give similar converted to gif with ppmquant ppmtogif most of the saving is the result of losing color gif save not cjpeg useful quality this is indistinguishable from the at least to my nonprofessional cjpeg you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the even with both at cjpeg this ha slight if you know what to look you could tell been jpeged without seeing the still a good image quality a many recent posting in usenet picture cjpeg characteristic becomes apparent at this setting help seen plenty of usenet posting that were of poorer image quality than cjpeg cut table but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing note that this file is the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality file is every bit a good a the better if you have a this seems to be a typical ratio for what are good setting for most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these doe not mean of the a some have the quality scale is purely not a percentage of the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting file that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to but here are some rule of the default quality setting is very often the best this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defect in a typical try if you see then go except for experimental never go above saying will produce a file two or three time a large a but of hardly any better if the image wa le than perfect quality to begin you might be able to go down to without objectionable on the other you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to the default is about right for compressing but to is usually better for converting gifs section for more if you want a very small file for preview or indexing and are prepared to tolerate large a setting in the range of to is about or so may be amusing a the quality setting discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section and to many program based on other jpeg such a image may use a completely different quality some program even provide a numeric just where can i get jpeg most of the program described in this section are available by if you know how to use see the faq article to find you have direct access to read about ftpmail server in the same that article appears regularly in or you can get it by sending to with in the the ftp list may also be helpful in the this list change if you have a copy more than a couple month get the latest jpeg faq from the if you are looking for the first part of this list is program that only run on one kind of if you see what you want for your check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over but some commercial program are listed x xv is an excellent viewer for and many other image it can also do format conversion and some simple image available for ftp from file version is a major upgrade with support for display and many other it is brand new and still ha some bug if you prefer not to be on the bleeding stick with version also available from note that version is not a good choice if you have a display get only nor for converting image to but work fine for converting gif and other image to there is a glitch in version be sure to check the at normal checkbox when saving a jpeg or the file will be another good choice for x window is john free imagemagick also available from file this package handle many image processing and conversion the imagemagick viewer handle display for colormapped it doe better color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg both of the above are complex if you just want a simple image try xloadimage or xloadimage support jpeg in it latest xloadimage is free and available from file xli is a variant version of said by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current at least with respect to jpeg because it ha the ijg decoder while xloadimage is using a the next xloadimage release will fix xli is also free and available from file both program are said to do the right thing with this cover plain for window or see the next one good choice is eric free which view jpeg and gif the current is available by ftp from file this is a good basic viewer that work on either or the user interface is not but another freeware viewer is mohammad the current is available from and mirror site note file hiview requires a or better cpu and a memory manager and window and do hiview is currently the fastest viewer for image that are no bigger than your for larger it scale the image down to fit on the screen than using a most viewer you may or may not prefer this but no denying that it slows down loading of large image installation is a bit read the direction a shareware alternative is colorview for do this is easier to install than either of the two freeware it user interface is also much although personally i find it harder to use more inconsistent it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than at least on my image larger than screen dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same and both are faster than the current version is available from and mirror site note file requires a vesa graphic if you have look in or from the same recent pc have a vesa so try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is a second shareware alternative is which ha been kicking around the net for a but i know any stable archive location for the current version is inferior to the above viewer the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the archive at that the gif viewer compushow support jpeg in it latest jpeg implementation very slow half the speed of the above and image quality is poor except on too bad have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in available from and mirror site note file due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic any one of these viewer might not work on your particular if you get of them to need to use one of the following conversion program to convert jpeg to then view with your favorite gif you have use gif a the intermediate try to find a viewer is reputed to do the right thing with the independent jpeg free jpeg converter are ftpable from and mirror site note file if you have a and extended these file are do compilation of the free source code described in section they will convert jpeg to and from and ppm handmade software offer free conversion these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif in you get color output from a the major advantage of these tool is that they will read and write proprietary jpeg format a well a the jfif since file are rather widespread on this is a useful version of these tool is free version were get it from and mirror site note file do not use hsi format for file to be posted on since it is not readable on handmade software also ha a shareware image conversion and manipulation image this will translate jpeg file jfif and hsi to and from many other image it can also display a demo version of image alchemy version is available from and mirror site note file note about the key archive site for program is full name run a system with weird directory where this document refers to directory at that really mean if you are not physically on you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rate from there are several internet site that maintain copy of the most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site a popular usa mirror site is which keep file in if you have no ftp you can retrieve file from by see informational posting in to find out if you are outside the consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest mirror microsoft there are several window program capable of displaying jpeg viewer are generally slower than do viewer on the same due to system note that you can run the do conversion program described above inside a window do the newest entry is which is free and extremely version is available from file requires window and this is a viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it and the image quality is noticeably worse than other but so fast use it at least for jview is fairly ha good and can write out the decompressed image in window bmp but it create new jpeg and it view jview also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer a brightness but an excellent basic the current is available from file of this archive can be found at some other internet including winjpeg display and bmp image it can write all of these format so it can be used a a it ha some other nifty feature including adjustment and the current version is available from and mirror site note file is a slow if you get the which is roughly colorview is another shareware entry this wa an early and promising but it ha not been updated in some and at this point it ha no real advantage over if you want to try it the current version is available from file understand that a new version will be appearing once the author are finished with colorview for dvpeg do also work under but only in not in a the following file are available from check for more recent version the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent version of free ijg conversion version version of for image archiver image with pm graphical strong on conversion viewing is a bit pmjpeg port of a popular viewer for window description in window pmview gif viewing very jpeg viewing fast if you have huge amount of otherwise about the same speed a the above strong display most mac jpeg program rely on jpeg which is part of the quicktime system so you need to have quicktime to use you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or running system you must also install the quickdraw this is on system you can get quicktime by ftp from file of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several with respect to it is marginally faster and considerably le prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg some application seem to have compatibility problem with qt mac user should keep in mind that jpeg is not the same a the jfif jpeg section for if you post image on make sure they are in jfif most of the program mentioned below can generate either the first choice is probably a free program for viewing image that are in jfif or gif it also can convert between the two jpeg the current is a big improvement over prior get it from file requires system and on jpegview usually produce the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg jpegview can view large image in much le memory than other mac in the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over pixel on a typical given a large jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the rather than presenting scroll bar like most other can zoom in on any desired some people like this some user interface is very well thought a shareware image support jfif and a well a gif and several other image the latest version is get it from file requires system or gifconverter is not better than jpegview a a plain but it ha much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion so you may find it worth it shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif image so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run faster with if gifconverter run out of memory trying to load a large try converting the file to gif with jpeg then viewing the gif jpeg a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion is available from file this will run on any but it only doe file not you can use it in conjunction with any gif previous version of this faq recommended imagery jpeg a converter based on an old version of the ijg if you are using this you definitely should replace it with jpeg free program pictpixie can view image in quicktime and gif and can convert between these you can get pictpixie from file requires pictpixie wa intended a a and really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with some of it drawback are that it requires lot of it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything le than a and it ha a relatively unfriendly user pictpixie is an unsupported meaning it ha some minor bug that apple doe not intend to is an old version of called floating around the if you have this you should trash a even the quicktime starter kit includes a much descendant of pictpixie called picture note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the storm picture decompress is a free jpeg this rather old program is inferior to the above program in many but it will run without system or so you may be forced to use it on older doe need so really old machine use you can get it from file you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to to allow picture decompress to open if your machine is too old to run quickdraw mac plus for gifconverter is your only choice for jpeg if you want to pay for use jpeg convert and a free gif more and more commercial mac application are supporting although not all can deal with the jfif adobe version or can read and write jpeg file the jpeg from the acquire you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to to allow photoshop to recognize program listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at there are many mirror site of this archive and you should try to use the closest in the a good choice is look under hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg a well a being a general image manipulation cheap and can read several format besides the current version is a demo version is available from mirror file the demo version will crop image larger than but it is otherwise fully is an image renderer that can display and gif the program can be used to create even capturing frame from rendering package like the current version is available from mirror file although this directory is supposedly for amigados the program will also run under amigados or viewtek is a free the current version is available from mirror file if willing to spend real there are several commercial package that support two are written by thomas the author of and these are a standalone image morphing and an impressive image effect and prepress package that also includes both are distributed by great valley art department professional from asdg is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for from black belt is another commercial graphic package with jpeg the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from mirror in directory file these program convert jpeg the amiga world is heavily infested with jpeg many based on an ancient version of the free ijg jpeg software to a certain magazine that published same on it without so much a notifying the among these are and probably others i have not even heard in my anything older than ijg version is not worth the disk space stored if you have such a trash it and get something atari the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari from file these program convert jpeg targa for monochrome st try which manages to achieve grayscale effect by version read jpeg available from file i have not heard of any other free or shareware viewer for but surely there must be some by pointer acorn supplied with risc o version can convert from and view jpeg jfif provision is also made to convert image to although this must be done from the cli rather than by recent version of the shareware program translator can handle along with about other image while older version can be found on some archimedes the current version is only available by registering with the john nutterbrink the price dutch guilder or also a commercial product called which provides jpeg functionality and direct jpeg a well a a host of other image format conversion and processing this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above dt portable software for almost any if none of the above fit your you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in also need a viewer if your display is bit or any gif viewer will do if you have a display with more color try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm image there are numerous commercial jpeg with more popping up every i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too in that purchase a ask pointed question about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file many of the earliest commercial release are not and never will be compatible with anyone if you are looking for source code to work portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg which i a package containing our source and some small test file is available from several the archive site for this source code is or look under directory the current release is is a compressed tar forget to retrieve in binary you can retrieve this file by ftp or if you are on a pc and know how to cope with you may prefer zip which you can find at and mirror site note file this file will also be available on in the graphsupport forum library a if you have no ftp you can retrieve the source from your nearest version appeared a issue of volume you know how to retrieve see the faq article to find referred to at the top of section the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg format and image file in pbmplus utah and truevision targa file the core compression and decompression module can easily be reused in other such a image the package is highly we have tested it on many machine ranging from pc to we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial company are welcome to use it a the basis for we do not ask a although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature the readme file in the distribution for we hope to make this software a with anything we offer no warranty and accept no the independent jpeg group is a volunteer if like to contribute to improving our you are welcome to all this hoopla about color most people have bit per display typical display hardware store or fewer bit per so it can display or fewer distinct color at a to display a the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative this process is called is something of a would be a better stuck with the standard usage color quantization is a lossy it turn out that for most the detail of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduced by jpeg at the very lowest jpeg quality since jpeg is a converting a color jpeg image for display on hardware requires color this is true for color even if you feed a gif into what come out of the decompressor is but thousand of this happens because lossiness affect each pixel a little so two pixel that started with identical color will probably come out with slightly different each original color get into a group of nearby therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped regardless of the image the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for because of this effect nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color used by a jpeg even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error i occasionally see posted image described a this tell me that the poster read this faq and probably converted the jpeg from a jpegs can be classified a color or like but number of color just a useful concept for on the other a gif image by definition ha already been quantized to or fewer gif have a definite number of color in it and the format allow more than palette for purpose of usenet picture gif ha the advantage that the sender precomputes the color so recipient have this is also the of stuck with the if the sender quantized to a different number of color than what you can you have to resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a if the sender use a color quantization out of for this jpeg offer the promise of significantly better image quality for all user whose machine match the display full color image can be quantized to precisely match the display you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm is a lot of active research in this or purchase better display to get a better view of jpeg image you already with a stuck forevermore with what wa also worth mentioning that many program include rather shoddy quantization if you view a gif on a ega for you are probably getting a much worse image than you need this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantization to create the one to display but often also due to jpeg conversion program will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable result at and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be jpeg is likely to provide better result than the average gif program for display a well a an number of people have display hardware pc true display on workstation and for these gif is already a it cannot represent an image to the full capability of their jpeg image can drive these display much more jpeg is an better choice than gif for representing image in a how doe jpeg the to know are chrominance discrete cosine coefficient and huffman or arithmetic entropy this long enough so not going to say more than that for technical see the this is available from the archive at in file if you need help in using the see the top of this what about lossless a great deal of confusion on this the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression one that guarantee the final output is identical to the original this lossless mode ha almost nothing in common with the lossy jpeg and it offer much le at very few implementation of lossless jpeg and all of them are saying to the free jpeg software doe not get you a lossless what it doe get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling the free jpeg you can also say to turn off keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation cannot cope with the resulting even with both quantization and subsampling turned the regular jpeg algorithm is not because it is subject to roundoff error in various the maximum error is a few count in any one pixel highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an at this regular jpeg produce file that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of but it guarantee if you have an application requiring lossless storage of image with le than bit per pixel color you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression this performs better than jpeg lossless on such jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on image with or more bit per jpeg is public domain least with a huffman back while the jbig technique are heavily covered by why all the argument about file strictly jpeg refers only to a family of compression it doe refer to a specific image file the jpeg committee wa prevented from defining a file format by turf war within the international standard since we actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file this leaf u with a in the absence of official a number of jpeg program writer have just gone off to their own and a a result their program compatible with anybody the closest thing we have to a standard jpeg format is some work been coordinated by people at they have defined two file jfif file interchange a format that transport pixel and not much aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff tiff is a format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than and may well prove le because different vendor have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subset of not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this both of these format were developed with input from all the major vendor of reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both i believe that usenet should adopt jfif a the replacement for gif in picture jfif is simpler than tiff and is available the tiff spec ha only recently been officially and it is still unusably vague on some crucial even when is well the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported common file may never be a a particular case that people may be interested in is quicktime software for the quicktime us a format wrapped inside the pict conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty and several mac program are available to do it mac portion of section if you have an editor that handle binary you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by see section for another particular case is handmade program and image these program are capable of reading and writing jfif by they write a proprietary format developed by this format is not readable by any program and should not be used for usenet use the switch to get jfif applies to old version of these the current release emit jfif format by you still should be careful not to post unless you want to get flamed by people on how do i recognize which file format i and what do i do about if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few byte of the a file will start with the character ff ff followed by two variable byte hex followed by if you see ff at the but not the rest of you may have a this is probably decodable by jfif software worth a hsi file start with out of luck unless you have hsi portion of the file may look like plain jpeg but they decompress properly with a macintosh pict if will have a couple hundred byte of header followed by a jfif header for strip off everything before the ff and you should be able to read anything a proprietary or not jpeg at if you are the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream for ff try stripping off everything before in uuencoded usenet the characteristic jfif pattern is line whereas uuencoded hsi file will start with line if you learn to check for the you can save yourself the trouble of downloading what about arithmetic the jpeg spec defines two different module for the final output of compressed either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is the choice ha no impact on image but arithmetic coding usually produce a smaller compressed on typical arithmetic coding produce a file or percent smaller than huffman the number previously cited are for huffman the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patent owned by and thus cannot legally use arithmetic unless you obtain license from these doctrine allows people to implement and test the but actually storing any image with it is dubious at at least in the short i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic the space saving great enough to justify the potential legal in arithmetic coding be used for any image to be exchanged on there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the stay tuned for further doe loss accumulate with repeated it would be nice having compressed an image with you could decompress manipulate it off a and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost unfortunately this is not the in recompressing an altered image loses more though usually not a much a wa lost the first time the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it changing then there is no further you get an identical jpeg even this is not at not with the current free jpeg essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff if you repeatedly compress and the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the usually take many such cycle to get visible one of the thing on our list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or but i am not optimistic about in any the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified output of at the original quality would introduce no further even such simple change a cropping off a border could cause further wondering because the boundary if you cropped off only multiple of you might be but a mighty limited the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of but you want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation use a lossless format while working on the then jpeg it when you are ready to file it aside from avoiding you will save a lot of time this way what are some rule of thumb for converting gif image to a stated you lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to if you can obtain the original data the gif wa made far better to make a jpeg from but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work here are some suggestion for getting maximum space saving with minimum loss of the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each to make sure you are happy with before throwing away the corresponding that will give you a chance to the conversion with a higher quality setting if some gifs may be better left a a explained in section in gifs with sixteen or fewer color convert you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be than the check the size experience to date suggests that gifs are the best candidate for conversion to they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential and they convert to jpeg with least waste your time converting any gif much under expect jpeg file converted from gifs to be a small a those created directly from to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted file be a much a twice a big a jpeg file would be shoot for or the size of the gif not a suggested in earlier many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large border around a gif while this wa nearly free in term of storage cost in gif it is not free in jpeg and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact do yourself a favor and crop off any border before you are on an x window manual and automatic cropping function are a very painless way to do default q setting of is appropriate for but for gif q setting of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image you apply smoothing a suggested the higher q setting may not be color gifs of photograph or complex artwork are usually to fool your eye into seeing more than the color that gif can actually if you enlarge the you will see that adjacent pixel are often of significantly different at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color the trouble with dithering is to it look like color and jpeg compress noise very the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image you had to get around you want to the gif image before smoothing average together nearby thus approximating the color that you thought you saw and in the process getting rid of the rapid color change that give jpeg appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q thus further reducing the size of the compressed while still obtaining a output image than get without with the free jpeg software product based on a simple smoothing capability is built try or so when converting value of to seem to work well for dithering may require larger smoothing you can see regular pattern on the gif image even without then strong smoothing is definitely called too large a smoothing factor will blur the output which you if you are an image processing you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering such a pnmconvol from the pbmplus smoother is a lot faster than the upshot of all this is that is probably a good starting point for converting but if you really care about the want to check the result and maybe try a few other for more information about jpeg in

general quality of argument found is this article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to in the hope of improving the general level of logic is the science of or inference logic allows u to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not or of one doe not need to study logic in order to reason a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally the matter is very much open for this document merely explains how to use given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the proposition are the building block of a logical a proposition is a statement which is either true or for is or is proposition may be either asserted to be or denied to be note that this is a technical meaning of not the everyday the proposition is the meaning of the not the particular arrangement of word used to express so and exists a both express the same an argument to quote the monty python connected series of statement to establish a definite an argument consists of three first of the proposition which are necessary for the argument to continue are these are called the premise of the they are the evidence or reason for accepting the argument and it premise are often indicated by phrase such a and so phrase is often viewed with a it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious if something seem obvious to be afraid to question you can always say it is when heard the the premise are used to derive further proposition by a process known a in one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other proposition already there are various form of valid the proposition arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference is often denoted by phrase such a or we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premise and conclusion are often indicated by phrase such a follows and so the conclusion is often stated a the final stage of for every event ha a cause the universe ha a beginning all beginning involve an event this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event therefore the universe ha a cause and note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular the term do not make sense in sometimes an argument will not follow the order given for the conclusion might be stated first and the premise stated afterwards in support of the this is perfectly if sometimes a little recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premise or many people shower their writing with assertion without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe a an some statement look like but are for the bible is jesus must either have been an evil or the son of this is not an it is a conditional it doe not assert the premise which are necessary to support what appears to be it also suffers from a number of other logical but come to those another created therefore do your duty to the phrase your duty to

statement is an if trying to establish the truth of then it is not an it is an for must be something wrong with the engine of my because it will not this is an car will not start because there is something wrong with the this is an there are two traditional type of deductive and a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of it conclusion that an argument where if the premise are the conclusion must also be a deductive argument is either valid or a valid argument is defined a one where if the premise are then the conclusion is an inductive argument is one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the inductive argument are not valid or we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other and about how probable their premise there are form of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor we will concentrate for the moment on deductive a they are often viewed a the most rigorous and it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid doe not imply that it conclusion this is because of the slightly nature of which we must now consider more obviously a valid argument can consist of true an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false for all insect have wing woodlouse are insect therefore woodlouse have wing the conclusion is not true because the premise are if the premise were the conclusion would be the argument is thus entirely more we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false a all fish live in the sea dolphin are fish therefore dolphin live in the sea the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true we can therefore draw up a for the symbol denotes is the the and represent true and false premise conclusion inference a b f f t if the premise are false and the inference f t t the conclusion can be true or t f f if the premise are true and the conclusion the inference must be t t t if the premise are true and the inference the conclusion must be a sound argument is a valid argument whose premise are a sound argument therefore arrives at a true be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound to delve further into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoided when constructing an these pitfall are known a in everyday english the term is used to refer to mistaken belief a well a to the faulty reasoning that lead to those this is fair but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect especially if the argument appears valid or so for the purpose of this we define a fallacy a a logical argument which appears to be but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more by studying fallacy we aim to avoid being misled by the following list of fallacy is not intended to be argumentum ad baculum to the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a it is often used by and can be summarized a make the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the for thus there is ample proof of the truth of the all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally directed at the the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs instead of trying to disprove the truth of an the arguer attack the person or people making the this is invalid because the truth of an assertion doe not depend upon the goodness of those asserting for is an evil it is practised by communist and sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by for that he is a known this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the and not argumentum ad it doe not demonstrate that the testimony is to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam elsewhere in this the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the particular for is perfectly acceptable to kill animal for how can you argue otherwise when quite happy to wear leather this is an abusive charge of used a an excuse for dismissing the this fallacy can also be used a a mean of rejecting a for course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad this particular form of argumentum ad when one alleges that adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish is also known a the argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean from this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it ha not been proved when it is argued that something must be false because it ha not been proved that this is not the same a assuming that something is false until it ha been proved a basic scientific course the bible is nobody can prove course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not nobody ha shown any proof that they are note that this fallacy doe not apply in a court of where one is generally assumed innocent until proven in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of it having the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not for flood a described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the the earth doe not have a tenth a much even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the therefore no such flood in we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something ha not we cannot conclude with certainty that it ha not argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to also known a special the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion for did not murder my mother and father with an please find me suffering enough through being an argumentum ad populum this is known a appealing to the or appealing to the to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive for must be it is violence against bible must be million of people know that it are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a the more likely it is that that proposition is argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority us the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an for newton wa a genius and he believed in this line of argument is not always completely for reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that for we can distinguish quite clearly hawking ha concluded that black hole give off and searle ha concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent hawking is a and so we can reasonably expect his opinion on black hole radiation to be searle is a so it is questionable whether he is to speak on the subject of machine the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose circumstance mean that the rule is it is the error made when one go from the general to the for generally dislike you are a so you must dislike this fallacy is often committed by moralist and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of it occurs when one form a general rule by examining only a few specific case which are not representative of all possible for bakker wa an insincere therefore all christian are sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known a false cause the

me of the the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the for soviet union collapsed after taking up therefore we must avoid atheism for the same cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter it asserts that because two event occur they must be causally and leaf no room for other factor that may be the of the petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premise are at least a questionable a the conclusion circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one

official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their and will be open to therefore homosexual cannot be allowed to hold government note that the argument is entirely the premise is the same a the an argument like the above ha actually been cited a the reason for the british secret official ban on homosexual another example is the know that god exists because the bible tell u and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of one example is the classic loaded you

politician often ask loaded question such long will this ec interference in our affair be allowed to or the chancellor plan two more year of ruinous ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument support a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that for a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teaching of christianity are undoubtably if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teaching are such

conclude that a property shared by the part of something must apply to the for bicycle is made entirely of low mass and is therefore very the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual item is shared by a collection of those for car us le petrol and cause le pollution than a therefore car are le environmentally damaging than fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of like it it exists in two the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to it for are studying at a rich therefore you must be the other is to assume that a property of a collection of item is shared by each for can destroy a therefore this ant can destroy a the slippery slope argument this argument state that should one event so will other harmful there is no proof made that the harmful event are caused by the first for we legalize then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and have a nation full of on therefore we cannot legalize is based on fallacy a type fallacy these fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are history based upon if then the bible also a form of is based on christianity is based on so islam a form of are a form of animal based on carbon dog are a form of animal based on carbon so dog a form of affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form implies b is therefore a is to understand why it is a examine the truth table for implication given denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form implies a is therefore b is the truth table for implication make it clear why this is a note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro the latter ha the form implies a is therefore b is where a doe not in fact imply b at the problem is not that the implication is rather it is that the falseness of a doe not allow u to deduce anything about converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form a then therefore if b then argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is or because the way always argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of that those with more money are more likely to be argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is an ad is one that employ constant repetition in asserting bifurcation also referred to a the and bifurcation occurs when one present a situation a having only two where in fact other alternative exist or can plurium interrogationum many question this fallacy occurs when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex non sequitur a is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premise which are not logically connected with red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being so that attention is diverted away from the point being towards a different reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated a a concrete shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or shifting the burden of a special case of argumentum ad is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or question the assertion being the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone position so that it can be attacked more then to knock down that misrepresented then to conclude that the original position ha been it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual argument that have been the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different in an argument about a general constitutes a claim that those situation are analogous to each this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking a position is it implies that you would not have supported martin luther you

The topic in topic modeling does not exactly match the dictionary definition, but corresponds to a nebulous statistical concept, an abstraction occurs in a collection of documents.\n",

    "When we read a document, we expect certain words appearing in the title or the body of the text to capture the semantic context of the document. An article about Python programming will have words such as class and function, while a story about snakes will have words such as eggs and afraid. Documents usually have multiple topics; for instance, this recipe is about three things, topic modeling, non-negative matrix factorization, and latent Dirichlet allocation, which we will discuss shortly. We can therefore define an additive model for topics by assigning different weights to topics.\n",
