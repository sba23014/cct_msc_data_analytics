Public transport in Dublin: some general thoughts,150,15x63ju,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/15x63ju/public_transport_in_dublin_some_general_thoughts/,89,"I'm back in Ireland for the summer after a long time abroad. I'm frankly astonished at how much public transport in Dublin has improved in the last few years. It's way cheaper than it was just a few years ago, when I was a student here. You can go anywhere in Dublin and its suburbs for €2. There are very few other rich European cities I can think of that are that cheap - compare it to London! Paris is €2.10 but just for the city centre - in Dublin you can get to Bray.


The Bus Éireann buses are drastically better than they used to be - they feel more like trains than the aging monstrosities from the 60s that I remember. And, again, going most places on them is seriously cheap. 

The cycling infrastructure has improved a lot as well, and, while not world beating, is better than many European cities that I've been to. They do need to extend the bike rental scheme a bit to the suburbs though.

The LUAS and DART services already function as the basis for a metro-like system. There are actually not too many European cities with a proper metro yet and these seem to do the job for Dublin. I think expanding the LUAS could be a viable and less expensive alternative to an underground metro - and more in keeping with European trends (places like Strasbourg function very well without a metro, but with lots of fast trams).

Other general comments: I think it would be cool to have water-bus on the Liffey. Probably quite cheap to build too, but I don't know if the river has the water level for it.

I haven't been on the trains yet; but I understand there are plans afoot to build a high speed network between Cork-Dublin and Dublin-Belfast. This would be amazing but maybe a bit of a vanity project.",2023-08-21 12:20:40

Cork is the 2nd city in Ireland and has lots tech and international busiemsses. Is the public transport designed this way to encourage people to stay overnight? I don't think it's fair to the city that you get to Dublin for busieness hours but not the other way.

I hope you all are having a fantastic day. 
 
I wanted to learn more about public transportation in Dublin. How much do you spend monthly or can you pay monthly subscriptions ?  I will be living close to Dublin 18/Sandyford. But I would like to travel to other parts of the city.

I have found a potential place to live but the landlord wants to use Airbnb to make transaction to happen. After I make the booking my friend who is Dublin can go and view the house and then if I confirm money which will be held by airbnb will be transfered to landlord and I will rent the property along side my tenancy agreement. Landlord also asked my passport details to send me an invitation from airbnb so i can start the booking process. If I dont like the house money will be returned back to my account, she also said she will pay all the fee that will be charged by the Airbnb. Can you trust this site? I really dont want to pay extra service fee on top of the deposit money. 

Thank you for your help ;)",2022-02-07 12:09:43

What should Dublin's rail transport lines be called?,0,12wji4a,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/12wji4a/what_should_dublins_rail_transport_lines_be_called/,24,"If you are familiar with London's tube map you'll know they all have different names. What would you assign to the Luas, DART, DART+ and Metrolink lines? For example, for the the Luas, I think Green should be called the ""Harcourt"" line (referencing the old name of the railway line it follows), and the Red the ""Saints"" line because of the various Saints placenames it passes through. For DART, I'd say maybe the ""Dargan"" line since William Dargan built the Pearse-Dún Laoghaire bit? Or perhaps the ""Amiensrow"" line (the old names of Connolly and Pearse stitched together in a ""Bakerloo""-like name).

Absolutely freezing evening, countless people lining the roadside  trying to hail taxis in Smithfield as FreeNow clearly wasn’t working for anyone. My mate realized he could take the 15 bus so we walked 20mins into town to a bus stop on Eden Quay and he got on his bus.

I thought I could get a bus home the same way and went to wait at my stop next to ha’penny bridge for a half an hour in the cold only for a crowd of people to form and when the bus arrived the majority of us were turned away cause the bus was full.  I ended up walking from the city centre to Stoneybatter at which point I finally found a taxi, all in all took me about two hours from leaving the pub.  I realize going into the center was a bad tactic as I could have easily been waiting a few more hours trying to get a taxi. If I walked home it would’ve taken me about 2 hours, feel really bad for those I heard needing to get back to the likes of Lucan and begging (already booked) taxi drivers to bring them home, even offering to pay double. 

We need better night public transport. Why do the trains close so early and buses are so infrequent if there aren’t enough taxis to get people home? Certainly a symptom of everyone getting sent out of pubs at the same time but it’s a disgrace Joe...",2021-12-05 12:55:46

The job starts early, there are no trains or busses that would get me there on time, so i  knew instantly I couldn’t accept the job. The area manager also told me that they didn’t have the budget to pay the salary advertised (€15/h)..

Step 3. Object to all and any higher density housing projects as the roads and public transport are already at capacity. Bonus points for mentioning the skyline or view.

Step 4. Object to all and any infrastructure or public transport upgrades. The disruption will impact the local area too much. 

Step 5. Watch as your house price and land value skyrocket as your area is now basically inside the city. Semi detached with a big garden too. Pricing everyone else completely out of the area and the city on a whole due to low density issues across the board. 

Bonus NIMBY points awarded for:

Leap Card (Dublin's integrated public transport smartcard): First Impressions,41,nat8f,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/nat8f/leap_card_dublins_integrated_public_transport/,50,"The [Leap Card](http://www.leapcard.ie) is [Transport for Ireland's](http://www.transportforireland.ie) integrated public transport card for Dublin. It allows you to use Dublin Bus, the Luas and the Dart without having to fish in your pocket for change.  It's Dublin's answer to the Oyster card.

I love the Oyster card. It's ones of the things that excites me about visiting London: I get to make use of this fully integrated system that seems to have been designed by someone with actual common sense; it has made the experience of working with London's bewildering (compared to Dublin) public transport infrastructure a little less confusing. It has eliminated the old ""Will I get a daily travel card or not? How much are bus-fares anyway?"" question that I had to deal with every time I took public transport in London.  It also means that you never have to fiddle in your pocket to find change when getting on a bus.  You can only imagine my delight when I found out that something similar was coming for Dublin.

Yesterday morning, I had to head in to the city centre to pick up my bike.  I had no change.  I thought to myself ""Aha! This is a perfect excuse to pick up a leap card."".  So I went to the local newsagent and picked one up.  The woman behind the counter asked ""do you know how this works?"".  I said ""em, no, but I'm sure I'll figure it out"". I paid, went outside and hopped on the first bus that came by.  I put my card on the ticket machine and announced my destination.  The driver pressed a button, and then looked bemused.  He said ""hold on there a minute, I've never used one of these things before."".  I stood aside and let all the other passengers get sorted out, and then the driver asked me to put my card on the machine again, and he poked a few buttons to see what was what.  It turns out there was no credit on the card to start off with.  That's fair enough.  I'd gotten change from buying the card, so I paid my fare, and away I went.

I got to the office, and I went online to register my card and top it up. Registering your card means that in the event you lose your card, you don't lose your credit.  It also means that the operator can track you in a rather Orwellian manner, but fuck that, I love me some convenience.  I applied a €20 top up, and clicked a button saying that I would pick it up by swiping at a red-line Luas stop.  At lunch, I trundled up the road to the Luas stop and put my card in the ticket machine.  It told me that my card was inactive and I should call the helpline.  I did so, and spoke to a lovely guy named John.  Unfortunately, John wasn't able to help me, but he did arrange a call-back. 

Later that day, the call-back came.  I have to go back to the newsagent and get my card activated.  I'm going to do that this morning on the way to work. 

So all in all, the only problems I've had so far with the Leap Card is that no one knows how to use the fecking thing.  I kinda anticipated some teething problems with the system, but I didn't expect it to take 24 hours and a return to the point of purchase on my part to get it sorted.  I thought the point of a ""Smart"" card is that it's centrally managed, and can be controlled from the back-office.  Once I get thing working, I may share more.",2011-12-13 09:01:39

The pandemic itself has really highlighted how little it has going for it, and how expensive it is for the sake of so little, but for a lot of people the choice seems to be made for them, more or less. It's just not sustainable.

I don't want to leave. I've lived here my whole adult life, and until recently it felt like home, but don't really have an option; barring some housing policy miracle this week, I can't stay. I have just enough WFH job security that I can leave, but that's only because a few things have come together, and only recently.

My question is... what happens to Dublin once a critical mass of people under 40 just can't afford to live there? Fairly clear there's no solution to that on the way, and the market sure isn't going to right itself.

In the US, part of the employer hiring crisis isn't just low wages, but housing scarcity in places accessible to commercial districts. Businesses in some places can only open a few days a week because people who need work can't get to them, and barring NY and LA public transport is lousy. A lot of people - myself included - have compared Dublin to London a few years ago, with people travelling long distances to work because investors have locked away all the property, but I actually don't think we're quite like that either. London's commercial hubs are famously well served by public transport and infrastructure in a way Dublin's aren't - a friend who left a few years back found it easier to buy property two hours from work in London than at home. So what happens if we get the worst of all worlds? Housing all gobbled up by investment funds like London, and work out of reach of big chunks of people like the US? 

What happens Dublin if most people can't afford to live there and can't work anywhere else?",2021-09-01 02:09:30

My father recently underwent cancer treatment.  He had 50 sessions in total and is cancer free. We live in the middle of nowhere. The treatment was in Dublin.

He couldn't drive himself. Thankfully, relatives, neighbours and friends kindly drove him most of the time. He relied on public transport a few times, too. 

Whenever someone took him, my mother prepared a meal for them as a thank you. 

As he's now finished, my mother thinks dad should give people money towards petrol. These people kindly took time out of their day each week to take dad to hospital, wait and drop him home. 

She wants him to pay either 50 euro per driver (so each person who took him gets 50 euro regardless of how many times they took him. Or pay 50 euro per trip). It will cost between 500-2,000 euro. 

Dad and I think it's unnecessary. The people who drove him did a good deed out of kindness. Mum made sure they had a good meal when they dropped dad back, before they went home. Dad thinks some people would be offended if he paid them.

Ireland is obvious target since it's 1.) not in a terribly bad situation 2.) I speak English, some sort of it that is 3.) seems friendly and affordable enough in terms of getting things started. It's just a good place to be in those dire times, or at least I can't find any better one.

&#x200B;

As of now, according to my calculations I will be bringing about 1300-1400€ with me, enough to live for a month. If it doesn't work out, well since there's no way back really, it's a victory of death kinda deal. Sounds dramatic but it really isn't, I bet I can make it work.

&#x200B;

But I know next to nothing about Ireland. I will arrive there on 4th October, in the middle of the night. It's going to be Friday and I have to get done as much as possible on that first day. I have tons of questions, and I want you, the insiders, to help me figure out a few things. I am not going to drop them all right away, I will come back every now and then with two or three important ones. 

&#x200B;

If you can provide any sort of help, I would be eternally grateful, honestly!

&#x200B;

**1.) Job Interviews**

&#x200B;

Guess what, I am one of those non-educated Slavic guys looking to get started in a land of opportunity. My only hope is to assault all recruitment agencies who can offer me some casual jobs in a warehouse, or a supermarket, maybe even a factory of sorts. That's the kind of places I've been working at and I bet I can handle it no problem.

&#x200B;

I have a reference letter from my current boss, I really don't want to leave this place and he really doesn't want to let me go. But what are the other options? He can confirm everything he's written in there, basically I can count on his support. Are reference letters from a faraway Polish employers even useful? It's in English, don't worry - although I had to proof-read it lol. 

&#x200B;

Oftentimes, I can see a *leaving certificate* required in job adverts. What is this? I've finished high school and passed national exam that comes afterwards at the age of 19, as we all do. Should I get it translated to English by a translator? Is it even worth a hassle, won't it be meaningless for Irish recruiter looking for a man who will lift heavy things? 

&#x200B;

Another thing I am seeing oftentimes is manual handling certificate. I think I will sign up for one of those courses before even leaving. What it's like? What should I expect? Is it your typical health-and-safety-dont-break-your-neck kinda deal? How long does it last? Is it honestly required and worth it, whats your take on this?

&#x200B;

Finally, do you have any experience with recruitment agencies yourself? Any recommendations? I gotta be swift and get a job asap, it's so important to play my cards right!

&#x200B;

I am confident I have everything that's needed (except I'm bit anxious about my horrible Slavic accent, but I slowly realize it's all in my head), but I gotta make strong impression on those recruiter guys, so that they'll give me a job, and it better be starting right away! What are another useful information you could provide? I'm sure it's not everything I need to know, we'll surely get back to this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2.) Public Transportation**

&#x200B;

I tried my best to understand what's going on with this whole mess and it's just beyond me. Maybe I'm not smart enough? I use buses and trams daily here where I live, and naturally they'll be my only option in Dublin.

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna play around with throwing little coins at the driver guy to take me to a new place. It's tedious and expensive. I need a monthly ticket. I also need that Leap Card as it seems. Can you receive it right away, or does it take a few days? Can I order it before even arriving to Ireland?

&#x200B;

Just cannot figure out how is that Leap Card thing working exactly. We have our own card thing and its relatively straightforward. Is 30-Day Rambler thing what I'm truly after? And by the way 160€ is damn expensive! 

&#x200B;

Maybe I just don't understand. What's the cheapest, most effective way of acquiring a monthly ticket in Dublin?  I've just had a look at their website a few times, and there doesn't seem to be much but its too damn overwhelming for some reason. Is Dublin Bus the most common bus network company something? Idk that's why its so confusing because we only have one public transportation company here, remnant of a communist age you could say.

&#x200B;

Communism aside, are monthly tickets honestly better than single ones? 160€ is a lot of money!!! It seems wise to invest in it because I might be travelling a lot between work agencies for the first few days. But once I get a job, will it honestly be less expensive than single fares?

&#x200B;

What's the most effective strategy in regards to public transportation? What should I always be mindful of? Overall, this is land of confusion of me. I want to be able to always get on a bus whatever it is and just don't worry about stuff, at least in the initial few days when I'll be on the move all the time.

&#x200B;

I would be so grateful if anyone could walk me through this process. It's a land of confusion for me. I'm probably overcomplicating it for myself (which is what I usually do), so I need someone who actually knows those things and can explain them in detail to a chaotic madman like me. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

As of now, that would be it. I sincerely hope I can grab some of your attention - and help! This seemed like the most appriopriate subreddit, since it's about Ireland and it has a lot of people in it. I know about more specific subreddits, but they're empty. 

&#x200B;

If this works out, I'll be back with more questions in a few days. In meantime, I'm looking forward to your answers!",2018-09-10 18:01:35

\- do not stop making the suburbs of Dublin look like they do right now, the houses made of what I can only assume is brick look beautiful

\- go to the beach more often

\- Double-Decker-Busses

Addressing the things I don't like:

\- might be a little specific, but Dublin public transport is just so bad. Why do they only show you when the busses leave the first station, how am I supposed to know when my bus arrives?  Why are there so many stations (literally every corner)? Why is a 7-day ticket so expensive?

\- bit too expensive

Originally I thought of asking about places that do Christmas Dinner but then some people over in r/Dublin seemed to lose their shit over someone thinking they might eat out and that's the worst thing you can do to hospitality workers. So I'll scrap that idea.

Then I thought I might spend Christmas abroad, might be nice to be somewhere other than my shitty granny flat, tenerife looks like it has options, it's mild too. But now it's looking increasingly likely leaving the country won't be the best idea.

So back to my granny flat. I thought maybe it could be an idea to volunteer, but given public transport won't be running, I'm not sure that'll be possible.

No real point to this I guess but to say the thing,but to know there's other people who are in the same position? Seems every ad is about happy families and togetherness and parties, I've tried to ignore it but it's getting more difficult, and I don't think as we get closer it'll get any easier. So I'll take each day as it comes.

What’s the hardest transport job to do out of these?,12,13ovs1t,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/13ovs1t/whats_the_hardest_transport_job_to_do_out_of_these/,25,"Was reading a story about bus driver shortages in Dublin earlier and how they’re offering full training and over €800 a week if you have a car licence.

My nephew’s stuck in a shitty job he hates just now so sent him the details about it but could tell he didn’t fancy it.

Got me thinking though, it’s a hard job compared to other transport jobs.

For instance a Dublin Bus Driver -
- Has to deal with the public (and everything that entails in Dublin)
- Likely to get their bus attacked at one point
- Has to deal with tight streets, pedestrians with blinkers on, complicated traffic systems.
- Other drivers

In comparison to other hard transport jobs such as an Artic Driver it seems like a lot more work for less money.

Artic Drivers I believe would be easier as there’s no dealing with the public (apart from deliveries), less town driving (mostly) so traffic a bit less of an issue, longer hours though and social isolation would be a challenge.

In comparison to train drivers who are paid much more I think both bus and Artic drivers get a bit of a raw deal.

Plus I’ve got a friend who’s a pilot for one of the long-haul airlines, difficult to get into and no doubt he’s highly skilled/knowledgeable but on a day-to-day basis he freely admits he hardly does a thing.",2023-05-22 16:33:17
Lack of common courtesy on Dublin Bus,142,qvgzpq,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/qvgzpq/lack_of_common_courtesy_on_dublin_bus/,70,"We need to be encouraging more people to take public transport over private cars to reduce emissions but Jesus lads are we making it difficult on ourselves. I've taken Dublin bus every weekday for the past 6 years, various routes, seen it all more or less.

Yesterday my headphones died on the bus, I had a 30 something-year-old lad playing techno on loudspeaker behind me, an oul-one talking (shouting) into her phone on my left. Finally, to make the absolute trifecta, in front of me two Russian lads arguing with a third fella on facetime. Where the hell is the basic common courtesy for other people on their commutes? Like I don't mind people chatting quietly but lads we've no respect for the noise we put others through in this country.  You cannot have a bearable commute on a Dublin bus without a set of noise-cancelling headphones.

50% of people in Japan use public transport, about five times bigger proportion than in Ireland. In Japan even having your phone notifications on will get you serious dirty looks and even told off because people are absolutely silent on public transport for fear of being discourteous to other people working or sleeping on their commute. Communal harmony is a big thing in Japan. We made a big cultural shift with mask-wearing along those lines, can we sort out this bus business and find a happy medium.

That's without even criticising the service itself, drivers can't drive, brake and accelerate too quick when compared to other countries so you're thrown around. ALWAYS late, pricy, etc.

TLDR: We need to incentives public transport use for climate but its a seriously unattractive prospect because of how loud people are and the service generally being poor.

Edit: Japenese Public Transport obviously has its own fair share of issues. Not saying we should emulate them, just be more conscious of the noise we're making and figure out a way to ask others to reduce it.

Edit2: Sweden has silent carriages on their trains. Stop getting hooked up on the Japanese thing lads. ",2021-11-16 20:16:14
Outdoor chess tables Dublin,175,14a0xq2,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/14a0xq2/outdoor_chess_tables_dublin/,124,"I'm approaching the council about installing outdoor chess tables in Dublin city centre.

Ideally I'd like a culture and community to grow around it, similar to Washington Square Park in NY.

So from that perspective the criteria are as follows:

Central enough so accessible by public transport from anywhere in the city.

A quiet public space, with not too much antisocial behaviour.

But with enough footfall and visibility to attract passerbys and to market itself to the public.

Large enough space for at least two tables.

Ideally a bit of shelter would be nice, but aware that's probably not realistic.

In time I could organise a Meetup group and tournaments.

Can people make suggestions of suitable locations please?


EDIT: here's a list of suggestions so far:

Iveagh Gardens, St Stephen's Green, Merrion Square, Wolfe Tone Square, Foster Place, Smithfield Square, Barnardo Square, Wilton Park, Blessington Basin, Botanical Gardens, Trinity College, Parliament Street, Capel Street, Portobello, Along the canal somewhere, Dartmouth Sq, gazebo by the pond in St Stephens Green.

Unpopular opinion: I applaud the DART track invaders,0,w72azw,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/w72azw/unpopular_opinion_i_applaud_the_dart_track/,72,"First off, this is a kneejerk opinion (maybe after a few soft drinks consumed) so more than happy to debate and would love someone to give another point of view.

The state of public transport in Dublin is atrocious (can't speak for all of Ireland but can only assume it is similar). 

We have a non-functional airport (queues to even get inside let alone check in, and even when you do check in you'll probably have your luggage lost too), we have nowhere near enough taxis (people being forced to walk home from the city centre in the early hours of the morning), we have buses that usually turn up late if they turn up at all and we have prices for these below-par services that would boil your blood. 
On top of the above we have a minister for transport who is (excuse the pun) asleep at the wheel, talking more about herds of cattle than the herds of suitcases lost in the airport and more about country people sharing cars than about fixing the actual public transport system.

These people had the absolute minimum expectation - that the Dublin Area Rapid! Transport (DART) would get them where they wanted to go in a reasonable amount of time. But as per usual, the powers that be cannot increase services to meet demand (maybe Eamon Ryan needs to redirect his fortune telling abilities from the environment to his actual job).

I applaud the people who decided enough was enough and staged their unhappiness by walking the rest of the way on the tracks in the hope that maybe the completely inadequate services would be recognised. 

Realistically once anyone knew they were on the tracks, they were in no danger, the kids were in no danger and the DART and government needed to take note of the unhappiness of the customers. 

Now let's just hope it makes a difference......",2022-07-24 18:27:54

Now, it shouldn’t go to sordid political projects like tax breaks for global companies in Dublin; it’ll be used to benefit the daily existence and opportunities of ordinary people living in the country.  

To start with, I’d look to address the housing crisis by building in communities across Ireland. Not massive homes but well-built, environmentally responsible houses with good transport, facilities and access to local amenities. 

I’d also look improve access to healthcare, making it free for all at the point of need and building new infrastructure like clinics, community hospitals and integrated health and social care hubs closer to where people actually live. I’d also invest in medical and clinical training to increase the attractiveness of a career in this sector.  

I’d want to improve practical opportunities for school leavers and invest heavily in vocational training so that everyone sees a future when they leave school.  

I’d improve economic exchange and public transport links to the North, encouraging all the people of Ireland to see themselves as a cohesive and mutually dependent community, whatever their historical differences. 

Finally, I’d invest in state of the art fast and efficient ferries to improve export opportunities to mainland Europe and bypassing the nightmare of entering and exiting the UK en route.

Sligo is one of the fastest growing places in Ireland.

Better connections to the North such as Lettekenny, Derry and Enniskillen is also crucial. There is also great potential for tourism in this area but it is oftentimes hampered by poor transport networks. 

Athlones Central location is key to its success. It has good transport networks and is connected to both Dublin and Galway via motorway and Railway. There is a decent transport infrastructure in place there. Athlone is also a hidden gem for tourism and one that should be invested in.

One would be considered careless but seven of them going missing in such a short amount of time is unprecedented.

For anyone unfamiliar with these they are bags used by nation states to transport documents and other items between the home nation and its embassies around the world. The  contents are protected under international law and they cannot be opened or intercepted. If one State opened another States diplomatic bag that would be considered espionage. (in)famously in the 1980's Charlie Haughey used diplomatic bags to transport his Charvet shirts from Paris back to Dublin.

Because of their protected status under international law they are very attractive to criminals to traffic drugs or any contraband. In 2011 the Gardai found a fake South African diplomatic bag sent to Ireland from Venezuela. Once they had established it was fake by its markings they opened it up and found 20kg of cocaine. They delivered it to the address marked which then led them to a cocaine mixing operation in an apartment in Navan, Co Meath where they found a further 7kg of cocaine and arrested 3 Nigerians for cocaine production and trafficking.

So this latest news that seven Irish diplomatic bags have gone missing is very suss. Anyone handling them in airports or postal facilities would know stealing them in transit comes with consequences likely to end up in prison. The ever secretive Dept. of Foreign Affairs are not saying on what routes they went missing. But given the numbers involved this is beyond careless and there is a fair chance we have an Irish diplomat working in an Irish embassy abroad who is in cahoots with a local criminal gang.

"About to have my first child, is it time to leave Ireland?",41,tm29cn,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/tm29cn/about_to_have_my_first_child_is_it_time_to_leave/,59,"I’m (30F) from Spain, my SO (32M) is from Germany. We currently live in Dublin, we have nice enough jobs and we are lucky to live in a decent apartment at a reasonable price. 

Now here’s the thing, we are about to have a baby, thus starting a new chapter in our live and I feel Dublin is not suited for it:
- We would have to move to a bigger place, either we start spending half of our income on rent or make a bigger commitment and get a mortgage, both decisions sound bad. 
- We would likely have to move out of the city and my company is done with WFH, so transport is a new expense to consider.
- The cost of childcare here is an absolute joke.
- Even tho I love Ireland I start finding Dublin too “dirty” and unorganised to raise a child.

I’m not sure if I’m being too negative or if truly Is time to move on. We are considering moving somewhere else in Europe (Germany or Belgium probably) but the language is going to be a challenge, for me as I don’t speak German or for our future son who may have to deal with learning too many languages.

Anyone has a positive experience raising children in Ireland? Or moving with family somewhere else in Europe without speaking the language?",2022-03-24 09:49:00
The rent is too fucking high.,1525,993lrb,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/993lrb/the_rent_is_too_fucking_high/,768,"Seriously, what the fuck is happening? Even outside of Dublin, rents have gone completely barmy.

When I first moved to Cork around 7 years ago, I was living by myself in a nice 2-bed house near the City Center, and paying €1k/pm on it. I was stretching a bit to rent it, but as you do, you make an allowance to rent a house that feels like your home. Place was newly gutted, and thus was a bit more expensive than other houses in the area.

Nowadays, €1k/pm in Cork will get you a 1-bed cramped apartment a decent bit outside of the City Center. Or a 2-bed dive way outside the Center.

This day last year, I was living in Cologne over in Germany. I paid €800p/m (which I'm told was way too expensive for the area) to live smack-bang in the City Center, in a very spacious apartment by myself. This cost included long-term storage in the cellar, water & bins fees, and the first €50 of my electricity every month. And considering I had excellent/cheap public transport readily available, alongside completely free medical care when needed - and could get a good pint for about €2, my cost of living was also way cheaper. Now, I paid a decent bit in taxes for all this - around the same as I'd pay here - but when you see so many daily benefits from your tax takings, and your cost of living is so much less, you really don't care too much about that.

How the fuck have we let ourselves pay such a ridiculous cost in rent again? Coupled with that, it's been done cleverly enough this time to ensure that a crash can't happen - previously, mortgages went mental, people defaulted, and the economy crashed. Now, if you default on your rent, you get yourself slapped out onto the street, and about 90 people will be queueing up to pay over the odds for your old place, solely because they've no choice otherwise. Either way, the mortgage keeps on getting paid and then some.

Man, I know I'm roaring at the wind here, but shit's gone ridiculous again. Barely even a decade since we lost the run of ourselves, and now we're getting stamped on for just wanting somewhere decent to live. And fuck knows how someone on minimum wage or the likes can afford this type of shite. I'm on a decent rate, and I still feel sick to the stomach when I see rent leaving my account on the monthly.",2018-08-21 14:28:35

It would be great if ye could add a comment to this post with a description or (even better) a screenshot of the map marking the area you are talking about. I'll update the map with your views.

So far I’ve used data from the board.ie, CSO.ie, the infamous Deliveroo drivers map, news articles, friends' opinions, etc.

It’s not science rock, just tell us your feelings about an area on a scale from 1-5. Taking into consideration all sorts of things: crime rate, public transport, infrastructure, etc.

**Dark Green - Desirable**  
**Green – Desirable with some minor issues**   
**Yellow - Liveable**

Suspicious activity near deceased relatives’ house,352,15sxgd3,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/15sxgd3/suspicious_activity_near_deceased_relatives_house/,242,"To cut a long story short my uncle died in the last few months at 86 and there is a dispute among his siblings (he never married and had no children) over the estate, my mother being the executor is particularly keen to get the house which is in a very remote rural area near Cootehill in Co. Cavan, along with the adjoining 6 acres of land sold off. He lives a very isolated life and had very little contact with anyone, he would get his neighbour to get his shopping with his pension and drop it in, apart from a hospital visit after a fall I don’t believe he travelled outside the area for a good 20 years. 

Myself and my brothers went to the house with her to check it out and take stock of assets etc, and spoke to the neighbour. She asked about how his niece was, he never actually met most of his nieces apart from the older ones, one of which lives in Australia. My own daughters had never met him. The neighbour told me she had seen a girl of about 17 coming and going from the house a few times, she had what she thought was a posh Dublin accent and when asked who she was she said she was his niece. The neighbour also thinks she saw another teenage girl around the same age in the front room of the house on one occasion talking with the other girl. She thinks the girl  visited on about four or five occasions in the months leading up to his death, and he never mentioned anything about them. He didn’t seem worried or anything. She didn’t see how the girls got there, there is no public transport, very dangerous roads to walk to and is completely in the middle of nowhere several miles from the nearest village.

On another occasion last summer she saw a man, a well dressed city gent with a shirt and tie, leaving the house and walking to a car which was parked across the neighbours gateway. She said hello to him and he replied in what she thought was a Donegal accent. She said her and her husband saw the same car, a new white BMW X5 with northern plates, parked in a lane way near an old bridge a few minutes up the road several months later near Christmas. She mentioned this to him when she was bringing in the shopping and he replied that he hadn’t had any visitors, even though he never left the house when these people were present.

Nobody in my family recognises who these people are, they categorically are nothing to do with his siblings or his nieces. What possible explanation is there for these individuals? Nothing was stolen from the house and he was in normal spirits prior to his death. Should the solicitor look at this?",2023-08-16 18:13:21

I like that is just over an hour to Limerick and just over an hour to Dublin - those seem like very reasonable commuting times to me.

However, my aunt in Dublin rolls her eyes and says being a central hub is about all Portlaoise has going for it. But she's a bit of a snob and would say that about any place that wasn't South Dublin.

This cut of 15% represented a significant loss of profitability and heavily reduced the ability of the airport to improve facilities. When counting for the total loss of revenue during COVID it meant more job cuts than should have been expected, and it has now given a severe handicap to the ability of the airport to hire staff at a competitive rate during a period of substantial inflation.",2022-05-29 13:37:48

Dublin and Dublin bus successfully turn it into the worst possible standards every day. I have to go by Pearce St, (don't know how many of you are familiar with the 66x route but allow me to fill you in). There have been roadworks by Trinity College for months now. The whole area is a total fucking disaster. It causes a detour around the college through insufferable traffic. Today as an example, I got on a 66 beside the Dublin bus depot in Donnybrook at 17.35. I am now at Wesrmorland St, at fucking 18.20. 45 minutes are you fucking kidding me?  Why the fuck are the roadworks still going on this long. Can our country get nothing done in any sort of reasonable time frame? So that's the fuck Dublin and Ireland's inability to plan anything portion done. Now on to the fuck Dublin bus section.

I worked for them at one point. I cleaned the buses at night in the Donnybrook garage (I think it's the biggest though Phibsborough might be).

Twice in the last two weeks the 66BX which is supposed to leave UCD at 17.20 has just not fucking showed up. Can see it on Real Time info but the time passes and no fucking bus. That's one bus.

Controversial (?) opinion on Dublin from a foreigner living in Ireland for the last 7 months,449,nq1h8g,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/nq1h8g/controversial_opinion_on_dublin_from_a_foreigner/,178,"I came in Ireland in October, originally to study (a phd, i am 25, long story, dropped out, now working remote).

I was kind of enthusiastic because it was one of my top choices around Europe : friendly people, English language, Ryanair flying you cheap everywhere, walkable city.

All these proved true.

I like how easily I can walk around most of Dublin's center, how good the public transport is, how friendly the people are usually.

But I came to realize that at my view, Ireland is run in a horrible way from a young person's POV. The best way to describe it is that they treat young people as pretty much ""not my business"".

The rents situation is insane and from all the people I've spoken with, there is not a single politician willing to do something for the issue.

It is not normal to need to share a house with strangers because if I want to rent alone, rent would cost almost 70% of my salary.It is not normal to see other young people having to share a room (!) because of the extreme prices.It looks like the Irish politicians don't care about that, that they want to shape the housing market for the owners, who are usually 40-50 years old people, and completely ignore the younger people.

Sinn Fien is - from what I've understood - the only ones that support changes in the system, but these changes are mostly directed towards the very poor of the society. Which is great, and 100% needed, but I don't see them representing the interests of the younger generation either. Am I wrong? Have they suggested ways to make living alone affordable for young people? Has ANY political party in Ireland?

The center has no toilet ANYWHERE and very few rubbish bins. Is there a mayor in Dublin? Does she care about that? I've heard that people complain about drunks littering the place and causing chaos. To be honest I've never witnessed anything extreme, unless you call chaos a few loud noises at night. And as for littering, well, put bins and toilets? Where am I supposed to pee? In the river?

Also, this vaccine passport business. Yeah, great idea, but why do we have to wait until August to travel cheap? Why don't you offer young people a way to either vaccinate faster or have a free test so we can fly too? My country Greece (which is neither really rich nor well run) already opened the platform for 18-29. Ireland is still at 45 ! They are pretty much making us pay A LOT if we want to fly abroad while older people can already !

Was Ireland always like that? A state that in surface is well-run, but if you look underneath, it is designed to assist the older generation and the wealthy enough to own property (houses, restaurants etc) and just milk whatever money the young people have?",2021-06-01 18:52:23
"Tackling public transport, housing, infrastructure: a second capital?",10,z1qoko,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/z1qoko/tackling_public_transport_housing_infrastructure/,32,"Some countries have specially built cities, major developments that were built with growth, infrastructure etc in mind.  Would something like that work in Ireland to tackle the housing and other issues?

Example: develop Birr, co Offaly as a second capital: draw industry to the heartland of Ireland, add major housing and educational establishments in same place. Build it from the ground up, include energy,  healthcare, public transport (Inc metro, aviation, cycle lanes, green spaces) and infrastructure; encourage companies to set up in Birr (or pick another place as second capital, Athlone for example), let the new major employers contribute to the build of homes in return for having a discount on the lands zoned for their factories' development.

Think big, think something like what they did in Brazil with Brasilia, or how the capital of Indonesia is to be 'moved' (a current development). Holland is full of specially designed towns and cities built on lands reclaimed from the sea, so it is possible to build from ground up.


Are we capable of doing this? High density living, close to work, a city designed for the future, no congestion?  Right now we keep adding to the Dublin nucleus, which doesn't work as there is no space to play with. What I think we need is a shift away from Dublin, but could it be done, and would there be support for it?

It would be to the benefit of many other towns to the west, nort and south of the new city, and make society (politics especially) less lopsided/tilted to Dublin.

What do I need to weigh up in order to make this decision? Deep down I don't want the apartment as it's a complete waste of money and kind of undoes 2.5 years of hard saving. We'd potentially only have 3/4/5 months in the rented apartment until we'd be purchasing a house all going well. 
No debt, home situation is fine, very doable until we get a place sorted, not being asked to leave etc. I know at this age ideally wouldn't be at home but I see it and have always seen it as a privilege to be able to do this, save buckets of money and get ourselves set up a helluva lot quicker than if we had been renting the past 2.5 years.

Renting a van with automatic transmission - is this a thing?,5,172h8xu,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/172h8xu/renting_a_van_with_automatic_transmission_is_this/,35,"Hi all,

Google has been less than helpful (maybe my search terms just are not exact enough) so I thought I'd give asking this community a shot.

My partner and I need to move and have been going back and forth about how to bring all of our items. (Moving from south Dublin to the west coast) 

We only have a smallish car and can't fit items like our desks, bikes, office chairs etc. so we were thinking of renting a van. But after lots of searching, I'm a bit stumped with the options available for automatic transmission. My partner only has an automatic license and even though I have a full manual license, I haven't driven a manual in at least 10 years (+ did my driving test in a country where the stickshift would be on my right side instead of left) and would only feel comfortable driving an automatic van. 

My question is does that even exist? If anyone has any leads on renting an automatic commercial van ( I think that's the right terminology) to transport some things, I'd be super grateful ☺️

Thank you!

ETA if push comes to shove we'd do it with a moving company/man with a van, but outside of being much pricier, we have two cats and would prefer to do the move 'at our own pace' and keep the stress level low instead of having lots of movers in and out of the house.",2023-10-07 21:21:02

Dia dhuit!

Here is the continuation of my story.

On the night of 11th of April me and my mom left Ukraine, on 16th we've arrived to Dublin port and on 18th we were finally placed into our permanent accomodation under temporary protection programme.

Now we are living in a tiny touristic village on the ""edge of the world"", Wexford county. Landscapes here are painfully beautiful and the air is so clean that we were feeling dizziness for the first couple of days. There is a wonderful wild beach just nearby our house, in about two minutes walk. We are sharing a pretty modern house with two other families, six people in total, every family has it's own bedroom (for two people) and a bathroom. We also have a kitchen, which is a big plus considering that everybody inthe house cooks daily. The only problem here is that there is very little space for storage and that you can get very unlucky with your neighbours,  like I did, but that's about it. We've been here for the last one and a half month and never experienced negativity from the locals that we've met. Volunteers are doing a colossal work every single day, speding huge amount of both physical and emotional resources. Local irish folks are very kind and supportive.

But there are still some problems. I do not want to complain about nothing and be seen as ungrateful whiner. I was told that if you will not talk about your problems they will never be solved since nobody will be able to notice them in the first place. Bevare that the following text may be unpleasant to read.

The main problem is public transport. It is severely underdeveloped in Ireland in comparison to Ukraine and it is honestly quite surprising. The thing is that in Ukraine owning a car is not a necessity, it is often a luxury. Nor me, neither my mom or our neighbours own a car or can drive one. The same is for the 20+ people that came with us on the 18th of April. There are about 250 ukrainian refugees in our village and only a dozen or so cars. There is no infrastructure in the village we living in - you have to walk for at least an hour to get to the nearest Londis shop and that's the only grocery shop available. There were several car accidents in our area with ukrainian pedestrians since there are no sidewalks. The buses ot the larger towns are only four times a week, with very little time even for shopping and the bus can also be cancelled. As you can understand, without proper transport those that wish to start working as soon as possible cannot get to their potential working places. I myself have to move to another place since I physically cannot work in here. 

The minor problem is that although smaller kids and teenagers are quickly integrated into irish society and learn english in perfect environment, adults are mostly left on their own. Ukrainian kids are already going to the local school and learn alongside irish kids, it's just fantastic! But if you an adult the only option for you is once a week english classes that last for about 3 hours. It is obviously not enough. The main problem is the lack of commication and thus socialization. While kids are happily integrate into society, adults are isolated in a tiny closed ukrainian community with little to no opportunity to spend their spare time. People here are almost desperate, thinking that they will never get a chance to finally work and function as normal. It is true not only for non-english speakers, but also for the people with fluent english. I personally do not have these problems, but as you may have noticed, I'm rather active, annoying even.

Overall impression: everybody is nice, and supportive, and caring, and kind, and want to help. But nobody really knows what to do with us. Also, bad public transport.

And that's the reality we living in.",2022-05-27 23:23:07
Buying an apartment alone,93,16fqfi3,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/16fqfi3/buying_an_apartment_alone/,87,"39 year-old Dublin lad, and got approval in principal for a decent amount, single income that is above average and affords me a somewhat comfortable life, even whilst saving...... I'm mentioning this not as a boast, but to highlight the issue I'm having.

Being totally honest, I want to buy in an area I feel safe and comfortable in, thats in a decent location in terms of amenities and transport to work, proximity to family.

The places I am looking at are in the region of 290k to 300k in price.... now to the issue..... the bidding wars.

It's not the house prices, it's the battle with other bidders. As a solo buyer I don't have the leverage of extra cash to up my bid. The last place went from 290k to 320k in the space of a week.

I would just like to know if there are any kind sound folk out there who found themselves in a similar situation.... did you just knuckle down and kill yourselves saving or, the dream scenario, did anyone get the coveted exception from the bank for extra cash.

Would really appreciate some guidance, feeling a little lost and frustrated, it took me a long time to get where I am and it's murdering me inside to think that I've still got a journey ahead of me.

Cheers ✌️

Just wanted to send a quick update:

Firstly, you're all honestly amazing, there has been some solid advice and I greatly appreciate everyone taking the time to respond and share their journey.... because it is a journey, a long one.

Anyway, my plan is to up my savings to 2K a month, it will mean a bit of a plain existence but the places that I'm being encouraged to go for (10% down on my budget) are just not quite what I want, it's the one thing in my life that Im not going to compromise on.
I understand that I need to lower my expectations, but I'll spend the next 8 months with the head down, and will save at the white knuckle rate. 

I will then do as suggested, aim for places that are advertised for lower than my budget and have some bartering cash and also money for fees.... hopefully.

Thanks again, and for anyone else in the same position, I wish you the best of luck 🤞🍀",2023-09-11 09:06:41

My Dublin experience during a Global Pandemic. Thank you.,413,fklgw0,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/fklgw0/my_dublin_experience_during_a_global_pandemic/,24,"
My fiancé and I have been planning a wedding in Ireland for over a year now. We flew into Dublin on March 9th with plans to stay a few days in Dublin then head north for our ceremony in Portrush. When we left the states the general consensus was that there was nothing to worry about, our government didn’t seem too concerned and Ireland only had one reported case at the time. That all changed, and it changed fast. At 2 am our phones were ringing off the hook with family from home telling us we need to get home right away. As the day went on we realized that our dream wedding wasn’t going to happen so we scrambled to cancel as much as we could and get refunds on everything    (not having much luck with that). We decided to make the best of a bad situation and explore Dublin via city transport and walking. We got to tour Kilmainham Gaol, Guinness Storehouse, Jameson, and enjoy dinner at Oliver St. John Gogartys. Every local that we talked to was so nice and sincere in their concern for us that it made us really think about what our next step should be, so that night we decided it was in ours and the people of Dublin’s best interest that we self isolate and book a flight home. The earliest flight we could get was for 2 days later so we booked it as fast as we could. The next day was when your government asked pubs to keep capacity below 100, as we looked out our hotel window in the temple bar district it was clear that most pubs were way over capacity and it honestly pissed me off. So many tourists crammed into such tight quarters with no regard to what harm they could be causing to themselves, Ireland, and their own countries once they return home. The next day we never left our hotel room except to go down to the lobby to schedule a taxi to the airport the next morning. In the lobby we talked to the security manager working the door and he asked about our situation so we told him. About 20 minutes later he knocks on our door and hands us some lunch that he bought and thanked us for isolating ourselves. It was at that moment the gravity of the situation really hit us, and we knew we made the right decision. After 40 hours of traveling and another 6 standing in line for screening we finally made it home. So thank you Dublin for helping us make the best out of a shitty situation and I hope to return soon to get the full Irish experience.",2020-03-18 07:08:55

I am a cycling commuter here in Dublin and noticed a good few of these things around. I think they are great, they go as fast as I would normally cycle and they're encouraging people out of cars and off our already packed pathetic public transport. I'm thinking of buying one just for messing about with at weekends or whatever.

I'm surprised our Nanny State hasn't rushed legislation in already though to get them off the road. Surely they'll want restrictions, tax, insurance, all manner of bullshit?

I know it seems most of Ireland are pro-car and hate cyclists and I'm sure these guys are going to be subject to the same ire, it's starting already as I've noticed a few articles in newspapers about them.

I give it 2 months max before they ban them from the roads or introduce tax/insurance regulations that will make them not worthwhile in the first place.

- Flood the place with share bikes. Make them so readily available they’re effectively worthless. Treat them like trolleys at a supermarket. None of us are bringing our own trolleys to the supermarket. Might have a few thrown in the river, but bike theft would be way down in general.

- Free courses to build your own home, with the government offering subsidised materials/standardised plans. Groups where you can do plumbing work in return for electrical etc. Land and services are provided by government but to be paid back over the long term.

- Tax free savings accounts along the lines of what Canada has, TFSA’s and RRSP’s (where your tax deferred money can be used towards your home also).

- Invest massively in rail transport. Rail to each airport first. First to object has to fight Eamon Ryan on the same card as Katie Taylor in Croke Park.

- Reduced sentences for criminals where you’d almost admire their creativity/intelligence (I think they’d be more easily rehabilitated/useful to society), but increased sentences for mindless stuff that disproportionately affects a victim/victims (say stealing a family dog to sell on for €50, destroying historic monuments).

- No means testing for social welfare. If you’re willing to ask for help in the first place, you probably deserve it.

- Flights per continent spread equally between Shannon, Cork and Dublin.

- Test adults for ADHD (if they want it). With absolutely zero evidence backing my claim up, we’re definitely one of the highest % populations with it.

Addressing the Housing Crisis,0,tygy26,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/tygy26/addressing_the_housing_crisis/,15,"This is a brain dump… but it seems like the breaks that the government introduced in the house market are the root cause of the housing crisis. What are your thoughts?

**TLDR** (at top coz this is long); Government policies of 20% min deposit, and rent increase caps have killed the house building market. Poor transport decisions have created housing hot spots. A financial crisis is coming (Ukraine / fuel impact), we need to act now to fix this. By starting to repeal these caps, in a controlled way.

The housing crisis is purely of our own making. This isn’t something that has been forced on Ireland by a global economic calamity, it was the policies adopted by a series of successive governments which has got us to this point.  But because it is of our own making, it is also within our power to solve it. By dropping the 20% min deposit and replacing it with an income-based evaluation will help demand for new houses, and help property developers create the new houses we need. As the opportunity for home ownership returns the demand for rental properties will decrease. This combined with a good public transport system, linking some of the more diverse areas to the cities will spread the demand for housing around the country.  Importantly we need to do this now as the global economy is facing another crisis. 


We are now in a position where there are simply not enough houses in Ireland for our own population. Where home stand vacant while demand skyrockets. Understanding how we got here will help to show us how to get out of it. It also shows us that knee jerk, patch up policies are the root cause of the mess we are now in.

The 2008 global crash didn’t cause the Irish housing crisis. It did however start a series of unfortunately policy decisions, the effects of which in hindsight are very plane to see. 

In 2007, 2008 house prices in Ireland where sky rocketing. Houses were increasing in value by over €100,000 in less than 6 months. The asking price, as estate agents at the time where keen to stress, was “only the starting point” for offers. Builders were throwing up houses at a record rate, white rectangular bungalows where sprouting like mushrooms on the side of Ireland's green rural lands. The builders ended up using substandard cement in the efforts to keen the rate of house building up.

Then in 2008 the bottom fell out of the market. Prices plummeted. Leaving many people in negative equity. Many left the country, dropping keys through letter boxes and leaving their un-serviceable debt behind them as the left for new countries. The boom was caused by the banking industry. In an effort to punish the banking industry and control the market the minimum deposit required to purchase a house was increased from 10% to 20%. This increase locked many people out of the housing market. Those who were now in negative equity could not effort to move, first time buyers and those in lower incomes were struggling to get the 20% together. Then the pyrite scandal hit. The substandard cement came back to bite. New build insurance providers went broke. Building companies faced with huge bills and no new business went to the wall. All of this happened as the global economy was still depressed and trying to recover. Inevitably this all combined together.

With tax returns dropping and the Irish state up against the wall trying to pay off the debts the banks had racked up, large government infrastructure projects where scrapped. Improvements to public services slowed, new public transport systems like the proposed metro links to Dublin airport where cancelled. Public transport is tightly linked with property prices, people generally need to commute to work, to access public services like healthcare and international transport hubs. 

The choice of where you live affects your quality of life, because it affects how long you spend commuting. It really isn’t the distance that is important, it is the time. So naturally there is a demand for housing near work and important local amenities. When the tube was built in London the promise of proposed new tube station would send property prices near that proposed station through the roof. People realised that this station would being them nearer to where they needed to be. The metro, and other public transport has the ability to do the same, and to spread the demand for housing around a larger area.

Those who could not afford to buy only had one option: rent. This was entirely predictable, people need houses, need homes. Rent prices shot up. Landlords sought to capitalise on this, increasing rent dramatically, forcing existing tenants and their families out of their homes just to rent the same property to the next tenant who could afford it. With their newfound wealth, it was possible to start purchasing new houses to rent out. They after all could afford the 20% min deposit. Large companies moved in. They invested in areas of large demand, naturally the commutable land around Dublin was of keen interest. As long as rent outstripped the mortgage these companies could make money. There was a public outcry at the rental price increase, and the government reacted. Introducing a 4% rental increase cap. The result: new builds for renting decreased.

At around the same time the new Dublin plan was realised at the heart of its transport proposal was to make Dublin greener. To make Dublin greener the report concluded it would reduce the number of vehicles on Dublin’s streets. How it was going to do this was simple – it was going to invest in new public transport. However, rather than invest in public transport to the North Side, which is not as wealthy as the south, and has cheaper less in demand housing, the report said that investment should be placed in the South Side, because there are more cars. 

The problem is the South Side has more cars because it is wealthier, many just don’t want or see the need to use public transport. The cost of a car to a person on the South Side would by less of their monthly pay cheque than a person on the North Side. Dublin would actually have been greener if the investment occurred in the North Side. But this didn’t happen. Instead, the South Side got the investment, and hence demand for housing in the South Side increased.

The house prices didn’t recover. The market of 2008 isn’t there, it isn’t back. So those who owned properties in which they’ve paid the mortgage for a 2008 priced house realised that selling it now in 2022 would net them with a loss, or at best a break even. So, what do these people do? – simple, they wait. Wait for the property prices to increase again. 

So now we arrive at where we are today. House prices stagnant. Limited numbers of new houses being built. Empty houses sitting vacant. We’ve got here because the government has applied small patch works of policies designed to appease the short-term demand of public opinion, and they’ve not thought about the longer term impact. It is politics over good policy. The 20% deposit and the 4% rental increase caps are small brakes on a single area of the economy and they’ve had a knock on effect.

The global economy is about to go through another transformation. The war in Ukraine and the rising price of fuel is going to hit everything, including agriculture and food prices. This will ripple through the economy, everything is going to cost more. High single and low double figure inflation can be expected. The ECB is likely to respond to this, incorrectly, by raising interest rates. When this happens landlords who are just covering their own mortgage payments are going to need to increase their rent. They won’t be able to. They will default or be forced to sell, all making a loss, a loss that gets passed back to banks – where do the banks go where they make a loss? – To the government, and to the tax payer.

It is time to remove the brakes from the housing market. The 20% cap should be replaced with rules around individual income and the repayment percentage cap. Where the max mortgage is based on your income, the min deposit dropped to 5% for first time buyers and 10% for everyone else. This will start to take the demand away from the rental market by making home buying accessible. This too will increase demand for houses and spur new property building to return.

A public transport plan aimed to deliver the best public transport to some of the most economically challenged areas is important. Linking these to rich urban centres will make them more popular, and help the folks that live there too. Importantly this will spread housing demand and create a greater range of properties people will consider.

I brain dumped my thoughts on here.

Better solutions for the housing crisis,0,12zaaxl,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/12zaaxl/better_solutions_for_the_housing_crisis/,58,"The government is trying to solve the housing crisis by incentivising more building. This is the most expensive and ineffective route.

There are potentially many vacant houses and apartments throughout the country, including in Dublin city. They can be vacant for many reasons; including dilapidation and bad location. And including investors leaving them empty in large numbers, in order to create a shortage, to push up the prices of their other properties.

First, the government must find the vacant housing, by comparing the list of domiciles on the Property Registry with people's addresses from the PPS registry. It must tax the owners of vacant properties, forcing the owners to ulitise, develop or sell them.

Then the government must prevent investment funds from owning residential property. It has been proposed to increase the tax rental businesses pay, but it is too late for that now. Only a total ban on businesses (non-people) from property ownership will suffice, to free up the amount of housing needed today for new home-owners and private landlords. Exceptions like universities, housing cooperatives and doctors' offices can apply for a licence to own housing.

If those measures are not enough, there is more that must be done before resorting to large scale building. A policy of gradually lowering the mortgage term limit (currently 35 years) is needed to keep house prices stable. It reduces the amount people can borrow, which reduces house prices proportionately. This makes housing a bad investment (unless you plan to live in the house) and a very bad investment if you plan to leave the house empty. This an extension of the existing macroprudential policy advocated by the central bank.

Planning regulation changes are needed too. Building offices in cities with housing shortages must only be permitted alongside the construction of a greater number of housing units. Building housing in an area with few jobs must only be permitted alongside the construction of employers like offices and retail. This not only ensures housing is built where it is needed, and reduces prices in pressure areas. It also reduces commuting distances and road traffic, and the need for new public transport infrastructure.

As things stand, more construction is not an effective way to resolve the housing crisis. The above structural problems must be solved first.

These new estates now being built are simply creating problems for tomorrow. They are consuming Ireland's countryside and vital arable land. They are creating transportation and social problems due to their isolation from the towns. The big build policy only serves the desires of developers, not the people.",2023-04-26 07:51:11

The reality of living on social welfare in Ireland.,1002,qndj0b,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/qndj0b/the_reality_of_living_on_social_welfare_in_ireland/,316,"**WARNING:** This is an absolute unit of a post, so if you don't want to read it, I understand and recommend you click away.

It's become very popular in Ireland to bash those who live on social welfare. I was on social welfare for approx 6 years, and I have a few things to say about it. I was on Disability Allowance, and there was just no way I could work at that time. Almost everyone would say I was 'one of the good ones'. I had no income, no way of even trying to make an income, and it sucked balls.

But I have complete sympathy for those who are physically able to work and are in receipt of SW too. For a start, depending on your condition it can be incredibly difficult to get onto Disability Allowance. For whatever reason, I sent a doctor's letter off when I was 16 and was approved, no questions asked. Haven't so much as heard from them since then. But friends of mine are reviewed yearly, and inspectors come into their houses to see if they are living according to their income. They can't force entry like the guards obviously, but they schedule appointments, and if you don't cooperate, they cut you off. These inspections seem to happen most often to married people.

So there's a couple of people on Jobseekers' allowance with serious medical conditions, like depression, who couldn't convince the deciding officers to give them DA, at least not first time. I won't say there's a lot of them, as I have no concrete numbers, I'll just say I know a couple, so they could be rare as hen's teeth for all I know, but it does happen.

What I do have solid numbers for is unemployment. We were at our lowest unemployment in the history of the state just before Covid hit. In fact, according to economists, it is not desirable in most countries to go any lower than 4-5% because that generally indicates a lack of flexibility in the workforce. So we were basically at our ideal number for people who were eligible being in jobs.

I've had some angry replies when I point out this fact. Someone once said that there's a huge number of people on Jobseeker's who cheat the system by doing cash in hand work, but sure they would be included in that 4-5% anyway. It's hard, if not totally impossible, to find out who is ""deserving"" of jobseekers allowance out of the \~150,000 people on the live register in pre-Covid times. But when we take into account redundancies, short breaks between jobs, sackings, people leaving because of poor work conditions etc, we get down to 40,000 people who are long term unemployed (12 months or more), or 1 in 4 (all these numbers so far are from the CSO's website, go on their labour section to fact check me).

So I think it's very fair to say there's 40,000 people who are possibly 'scroungers', 'dole merchants', Jeremy Kyle type people that the Red Tops keep us angry at. It is certainly possible that every one of those people fits into that category, though I'm skeptical. The reason I'm skeptical is because life on welfare sucks balls, as I said.

There's a picture people paint that if you just keep waiting, eventually the social will forget about you more or less, and you can just start claiming 101 benefits and live the life of Reilly. Not really.

If you get social welfare, it is of course possible to get HAP. HAP will pay some of your rent, up to a maximum of €1300 if you are living in Dublin and have 3 children. The max a single person will get in Dublin is €600. Now that sounds class at first glance. But HAP is not simply given to you when you sign on. You have to prove you are in need of a new home. Now for some people they have managed to wrangle a new place without being actually homeless and on the street first, I was not one of those people.

I applied for HAP hoping to move out of my family home because, well, I was an adult man and it was becoming more and more difficult on my social life and mental health for obvious reasons. Had I thought I would ever come off Disability Allowance, I wouldn't have applied for it at all. But it was the only way I was every getting out of the parent's house, as the average cost to rent a room in Dublin, just a room, not a flat, is now €600 (according to [daft.ie](https://daft.ie)'s quarterly report), or 75% of the social welfare payment. Long story short, I was turned down because I already lived in a house that was not unsafe for human habitation. So If you already live somewhere, you probably won't get HAP.  And if you have 3 kids and no job, well I think you probably need it. But the number of long term unemployed people with kids has to be in the low thousands.

If you add up the dole/DA, household benefits package, living alone allowance, fuel allowance, telephone allowance, and you also live on an island(!), you would come out with the princely sum of €13,689 per year, or still a full **€6,185.40 short of minimum wage, and €1200 below the poverty line**. I suppose maybe there are people lazy enough that an extra €150 odd a week is not worth getting out of bed for, but I imagine those people are few and far between. And probably don't live on islands. If you could get the max payment of HAP, you'd work out at about €30k, a very respectable sum, but people who work also get HAP, and so there would be no reason not to get that €150 extra by having a job in my mind, unless you were the sole caretaker for all three kids.

If it was so feasible to simply leech of society, to be honest, I would have done it by now- sure I was legally entitled to as long as I was unable to work. But it isn't really feasible for 99% of people, if not even more than that. A further scour of the CSO website reveals only 37% of HAP recipients were even unemployed. So there's 12,000 unemployed people on HAP, which translates to less than 10% of the total unemployed numbers.

So the Jeremey Kyle Dole Merchant group must not only be very small, but also supplementing their income with illicit cash to live anything more than a very modest life. If we imagine a 'worst case scenario', a single mam has had 3 kids deliberately to not work (a very common and frankly ridiculous trope on this sub), yes her rent is basically paid for completely, but she now has to feed and clothe herself and 3 children on 12k a year, not to mention the cost of a car if she lives in an area without public transport, as oh so many redditors. like to remind us.

**TL;DR:** It's absolutely shite trying to get by on social welfare. I speak not only from experience, but from numbers as I have presented above. If you have not lived on social welfare, why do you feel so confident in stating it is easy? I have never ran a company, and if I started saying it was easy and everyone should just do it, I would rightly be ridiculed. I'm sorry this post is such a monster, but I think there was a lot that had to go into addressing the narratives around poor people. I look forward to hearing people's thoughts.

&#x200B;

EDIT: There are scores of people replying to me, most saying very nice and/or interesting things. But there are a lot of people replying who quite obviously did not actually read the post, and are arguing with me over it. Things like saying people on HAP are not contributing to society. I thought that from ""only 37% of HAP recipients were even unemployed"", most people would be able to ascertain that 63% of HAP recipients ARE employed, but apparently that's too difficult for some people. Others are launching into rants about how I'm right, but there are people who are too lazy to work and that's what they're annoyed about, not me. Read the post. I only used my experience as an opening point, to explain why I believe welfare is not all it is cracked up to be. I go on to prove with the CSO's figures that people making no effort to work are in a tiny minority (0.7% according to one user, but I'll have to check that). If you want to have a discussion about whether 0.7% of the population being social welfare abusers is still too much, I will happily have that discussion, but I don't think it's relevant to this post. Thanks. Read the post.",2021-11-05 15:26:18
What are your monthly expenses including rent?,0,wul8p7,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/wul8p7/what_are_your_monthly_expenses_including_rent/,34,"Hi everyone,

I am not living in Ireland currently, but I and my wife are thinking to go back there next year or in 2024. I was searching about the cost of living and I found out that both of us would need at least 3.200 Euro per month to have the basics. This is how I calculated:

RENT-> 1800 EUR
GROCERIES-> 400 EUR
TRANSPORTATION-> 350 EUR
GAS -> 50 EUR
ELECTRICITY-> 50 EUR
INTERNET+TV-> 50 EUR
CELLPHONE->  20 EUR
GOING OUT-> 300 EUR
HEALTH INSURANCE-> 150 EUR

Is that reasonable to live around Dublin? (maybe Swords)

I need to earn 50k EUR per year to bring home 3200 EUR per month. To me, this salary sounds a bit too high, but it only can afford the basics. 

And how about in your home, What are your monthly expenses?

Building up in existing cities will cause huge infrastructure problems (that's why there's so much NIMBYism) because our infrastructure is crap. Land would be dirt cheap and would all be CPO'd anyway. So rather than wasting so much money trying to appease the locals and suffering from inflated land prices, wouldn't this be a good move? It would have a planned population of 1.5m and there'd be lots of grants to incentivise FDI to go there. It would be cheaper to build the necessary housing and infrastructure required to sustain the population, with the housing being medium-density with patches of high density (so 5-12 story apartments and compact, walkable terraced/row houses only) with recreation space also provided.

Edit: if you consider our stark population increase projections, I think such a project will be necessary to humanely house our people.",2021-12-30 23:27:00

DPD are screwing up hundreds of parcels from the UK,20,n897y3,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/n897y3/dpd_are_screwing_up_hundreds_of_parcels_from_the/,33,"[http://chng.it/BHtC4QvfXz](http://chng.it/BHtC4QvfXz)

&#x200B;

Every now and then the past few weeks, DPD are failing at properly importing batches of parcels from UK.

What should happen? When parcels arrives in their UK hub, DPD are supposed to submit the electronic customs data provided by sender to Revenue. Then the parcel is cleared, shows message on tracking ' Your parcel has left the United Kingdom and is on its way to Republic Of Ireland' followed by customs clearance in Athlone.

Whats happening? Some batches of parcels are being transported without this being done, despite the sender 100% providing the customs data to DPD.

The result? A large number of parcels are landing in Ireland having technically not left the UK. From my investigation I can see approx 50% of these affected parcels are delivered and 50% are held. The held ones are repeatedly rescanned in Athlone day after day, some eventually returned to sender, some 'vanish'. Most of the delivered ones end up in Dublin. As DPD serve Dublin and outside Dublin separately as proven by their post codes   ZZ75 0AA  and   ZZ71 0AA , it is likely there is worse security in the Dublin one resulting in many people being delivered parcels without required charges being paid. This is great and all... except on the opposite side the other 50% don't get their parcels at all. I can even see on some of the tracking of ones delivered in Dublin, 8 days after the parcel was delivered there is an update on the tracking that now says 'The parcel has left the United Kingdom' They processed the provided customs data 8 days after it was already delivered.

I have found 100's of tracking of lost parcels, you can see a good few people complaining on social media the past few weeks but of course most do not do this, they just try contact DPD. When you contact DPD they just say the sender didn't provide customs data but this is 100% not true. The affected parcels are from various places  (who you can find a few hours later had parcels processed fine) and the tracking numbers are successive, like their system that submits the data to revenue failed temporarily for an hour or two. This isn't a once off and has happened at random times the past few weeks.",2021-05-09 07:34:41

Wheelchair accessibility issues in ireland.,27,uwa0bm,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/uwa0bm/wheelchair_accessibility_issues_in_ireland/,25,"Right lads, I've a kid who's a part-time wheelchair user. Town I live in is fairly wheelchair friendly and we kinda know where we can and can't go. For the most part it's generally accessible apart from a few pubs, restaurants and the train station. We were lucky enough to be able to get an old small wheelchair adapted van (15+ years old) so we don't really have to rely on public transport and the 24hr notice.

Was in Dublin for a hospital appointment during the week and was out of the hospital with the kid by lunchtime. My kid is going through the ""viking"" stage and loves history, knights, etc so I said we'd try the National Archaeology Museum to see the Tara Brooch, Ardagh Chalice and the Viking and Norman exhibitions. 

Arrived there, ramps up to the entrance door. Perfect!

Ground floor, neolithic to Christianity fully accessible, ramps down to the gold exhibition in the sunken section.... grand!

Vikings, Norman's, Tara Brooch and Ardagh Chalice? All on the first floor and inaccessible as there is no wheelchair lift. 

WTF!!!

Compare this to the RDS. 100% Accessible, including the small balcony in the main hall.

A mobility lift in the national museum really wouldn't take up much space, no need to burst out walls or floor/ceiling etc. The only thing that would have to change would be one section of railings on the first floor.....

Why go through the trouble of only making 50% of a building accessible?

However we are facing quite an issue .. We have a cat and, of course, would want him to join the adventure. We are used to travel with him on planes and such so we thought there would be no issue. 
We have now been told (by Lufthansa and Aer Lingus) that there is an embargo (?) and that no pet is allowed on passenger flights (cabin or hold) and that the only way is to use the services of a cargo transport company. We have now been quoted 1.300 € for carrying a small mischievous 5 kg ball of fur, … one way!!! 

Is there another way to get a pet into the country ? Do you know of any airlines that do allow pets in cabin in their flights to Ireland (from any city in Europe, we are ready to do layovers)?

I tried exploring getting him there by car but apparently since we don’t own a car, we can’t get a rented one on a ferry …

(He of course is microchipped, has a European pet passport and all vaccinations up to date)

Can I clear up some Transport Misconceptions?,191,faafp9,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/faafp9/can_i_clear_up_some_transport_misconceptions/,111,"Transport infrastructure in Ireland is always doused in cynicism, we've grown used to it, but I would like to clear up some misconceptions I've noticed on this sub about the various projects that are on the way in the next decade.

**METROLINK**

Metrolink has not been canceled. It has not been delayed. The Metro line from Charlemont to north of Swords is still on schedule (give or take 3-6 months) to be completed by 2027. The line is basically finished being designed (meaning no changes will be made to the alignment or stations) and is due to be submitted to An Bord Pleanála later this year (2020), with the view of approval being granted at some point next year (2021). The last time the Metro got to this stage of the planning process was in 2011, a Railway Order was granted but construction didn't start because we were in the grips of the worst recession the world had seen since the 1920s. The economy is not predicted to contract between now and next year. So we can safely say it's going to start construction next year, unless there's a massive geopolitical shift.

TL;DR Metrolink is not cancelled, it's starting construction next year.

&#x200B;

**THE GREEN LINE UPGRADE**

The upgrade of the Luas Green line to Metro has not been shelved. It has not been cancelled. It has not been rejected because of NIMBYs in Ranelagh. It is been designated as Phase Two of Metrolink.

The Green Line Upgrade was proposed and was considered feasible because the line was only due to experience around 9 months of partial rolling closures of small sections of the line (80% of all planned closures to the Green line will only affect 1-2 stations). However, during the first Metrolink consultation, Dublin City Council informed Transport Infrastructure Ireland that there was a large Victorian sewer underneath Grand Canal Parade. This meant that the tunnel that was due to emerge from the Ground just south of Charlemont could no longer do so, so the tunnel portal had to be moved further south to it's new location just north of Beechwood (This is why the current Metrolink alignment has the tunnel stop south of Ranelagh instead of just at Charlemont.)

Building the tunnel portal north of Beechwood is what caused the construction period to balloon to 4 years (It had nothing to do with Dunville Avenue). But a large part fo the 4 year period was due to the fact that the Green Line Upgrade could not start until the northern section of Metrolink was complete. So the Metrolink project from Swords to Sandyford was due to be completed by 2027. The change to the southern portal meant the construction period would actually be 2030. delaying the delivery of the entire line

So the decision was made to split the two projects. By completing the Metrolink to Charlemont, opening the line and then starting the Green Line Upgrade, a saving of 2-3 years could be made.

So the Metrolink Planning Application that is being made this year includes the provision of the line to emerge north of Beechwood and continue to Swords. The Railway Order will be granted on this basis. Any politician that says they want to look at diverting the line to the south west or UCD, is lying, it's too late.

TL;DR The Green Line Upgrade is still planned to begin after Metrolink is finished.

&#x200B;

**BUSCONNECTS**

BusConnects is still happening. The last of 4 public consultations begins in the next few weeks and will last around a month. The project is currently around 6 months behind schedule (The NTA were not predicting the level of engagement the bus route redesign would have). The Bus Network Redesign is done (save for a few edits) and will be implemented in stages starting next year.

The bus corridors (bus and cycle lanes) all 16 of them are actually mostly non statutory changes. You don't need to go to An Bord Pleanála to reallocate road lanes. So the vast majority of the project will be implemented without statutory approval. The only issue is where roads are due to be widened.

Despite what media outlets would lead you to believe, Dubliners are not united against road widening. Santry for example specifically asked the NTA to widen the road and give them some permanent driveways in their gardens instead of implementing a one way system. Whereas areas like Rathfarnham and Rathgar don't want road widening and also don't want private cars to have to go the long way round. These areas will either not have continuous bus lanes, have a series of bus priority signals or will have their gardens CPO-ed regardless. (emphasis on the Compulsory). The fact is that Bus Connects Core Bus Corridors is not one big project, it's actually 16. So no matter what NIMBYs in South Dublin say about their particular area, the rest of the corridors are largely scandal free.

The Construction of the 16 corridors will begin on a phased basis starting next year, each one will take between 1-2 years to complete.

It seems all citizens of Ireland have been stabbed multiple times and are at the risk if being killed, or worse, every time they leave their house. 

I also learned there is no point in owning absolutely anything of value in Dublin. Your bicycle will be stolen, your phone will be stolen, and you will also be beaten up by a gang of teenagers. Also, they will kill you.

But don't even think about taking public transportation. If you are (un)lucky enough, the bus driver will stop, and you will get on. Teenagers will then pelt the bus with rocks, after which they will burn you and beat you up. Also, you will be killed.

If you take the dart or the red line, you will not survive. You may get lucky and only get beaten up on the green line. Then you will most likely die on a trolley in a hospital hallway, while waiting for care.

Learning to drive in ireland is depressional,119,t1am4z,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/t1am4z/learning_to_drive_in_ireland_is_depressional/,90,"I have to rant as I’m just fed up with how Ireland makes it a constant uphill battle to learn to drive for most people. I am a 19 year old and I scraped up about 5k to finally learn how to drive as I had gotten my learner license. I know I’m very fortunate as I was able to make that money in just one summer but I know many of my friends have been working part time for years and gotten that same amount.

Even with all this fortune, I had to rinse my bank account just so that I could get a car, insurance, tax, and driving lessons. I didn’t even get a car with a big engine or anything, it’s just a 1.2L Opel Corsa. I haven’t even paid much for petrol yet but I’m getting shafted by that with the prices right now anyways. 

In my family I only have one person who can accompany me to drive, my father. He’s busy most of the week, and the weekends he couldn’t be arsed driving around with me, so I get about maybe 1 hour of driving every month with him at max. No one else I know has held a license for 2 years so I’m forced to either drive illegally on my own or just leave my car on my driveway gathering dust as I get no practice, and keep paying ridiculous amounts for insurance, tax, and petrol.

Now I’m on the 4 hour bus (edit: it was 5.5 hrs, thanks bus eireann…) from dublin to Donegal just to get my final lesson done, which costed about €500 in total, and hopefully I can somehow scrape a pass, but who cares if I pass anyways, nothing is in favour of someone who wants to drive. Before people start with the whole “ah these prices are because of preventing people driving and increasing global warming”, maybe let’s give people a good transport system throughout ireland before we start with that shite.

Hope I pass with the minimal experience I will have, but extortionate prices I pay.",2022-02-25 18:17:44
"Are the ""Luas should be free"" brigade just shitty people who want an excuse for not paying the fare?",0,p1lps3,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/p1lps3/are_the_luas_should_be_free_brigade_just_shitty/,19,"Of course living in Dublin is shite but every city I've ever been to has charged for the public transport. 

I'd respect it more if it was campaign against paying rents above 5-600 to landlords who don't need the money. Why are you making everyone else pay for your trains and buses?

Also being a security guard on the red line luas looks f***ing awful. Why be another pain in the neck for them?",2021-08-10 09:23:00
Looking for Advice: Need public transport between Portlaoise & Wexford Town,0,x0ulou,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/x0ulou/looking_for_advice_need_public_transport_between/,4,"I currently live in Portlaoise, but my family all live in Wexford Town. I'm not driving so I depend on public transport between the two towns. Unfortunately there is no direct bus between the two. You have to connect at either Dublin or Waterford. A journey which then comes to around 4 hours or so depending. 

A car's journey from Portlaoise to Wexford clocks it at One Hour and 40 minutes via Carlow town. So it would certainly shave off the current travel time by a lot if we could have something that could cut across through Carlow / Kilkenny diagonally. 

I imagine a route like this could be popular considering its a link from near the middle of the country down to the southeast and up of course. 

So any suggestions, advice would be most welcome about who I would need to go to with this request. Would I need go to a TD, contact the Transport Department or start some sort of petition maybe. 

Many Thanks for reading.",2022-08-29 17:31:02
Accomodation in Dublin for Erasmus exchange students,5,ql7nvh,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/ql7nvh/accomodation_in_dublin_for_erasmus_exchange/,13,"Hi everyone, I'm a university student from Hungary, who is going to spend a semester at Dublin City University as an Erasmus exchange student. I have a few questions about Dublin, so I'd be happy if you guys could help me out.

1. Are there any relatively cheap dorms or apartments to rent? I probably won't get a room at the on-campus dorms, so I'm looking for places to stay near DCU. I'll have 2 friends coming with me, so I'm mainly looking for a place with 3 bedrooms or a place where 3 people can stay. I've already found Gateway Student Village and Schoolhouse Court, so I'm looking for similar places.
2. How much do bills cost? Both dorms I've found say that bills (electricity, gas, etc.) are to be paid upon the initial rent. How much does that cost monthly? 100, 200, 400 euros or more?
3. How is the public transportation in Dublin? How much does it cost? Is it possible to buy a monthly ticket? How often do buses go in the morning and in the evening?
4. How busy is the nightlife? I heard that most pubs and nightclubs close after midnight. Is it true? What opportunities are in Dublin for a night out?
5. How much does ""living"" cost overall? Adding together rent, bills, food, drinks, etc, how much is it monthly? 1000, 1500, 2000 euros or more?

Thanks for your answers in advance!",2021-11-02 16:11:55
Recommendations for hikes without car?,16,nr96e8,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/nr96e8/recommendations_for_hikes_without_car/,17,"Hi guys,

I moved to Ireland a few months before the pandemic hit so haven't seen much of it yet. Since restrictions are easing, the weekend is a long one, and the weather predictions are great, and I'm living alone and haven't seen anyone other than a few colleagues for months now, I'd like to go away for a bit. I'm looking to see if there are any two or three day hikes/walks that are accessible by public transport (so the start and end), and that preferably have b&b's or hotels where I could spend the night not too far from the track. 

Alternatively, I'd also be okay with going to a city/town that has several options to go on different longer (20km or so) walks that can be accessed by public transport, as I don't have a car and renting one is expensive as I'm on my own. I went to Killarney last year in August (my only trip so far haha) and that was great! Note: I'm based in Dublin, so have done most of the public transport accessible walks around here as well.",2021-06-03 09:19:38

What kind of car do I need?,4,xt4hic,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/xt4hic/what_kind_of_car_do_i_need/,35,"I have a full license but up to now have successfully avoided getting a car. I've been insured on other people's cars and rented. Recently, I've moved to a rural area and I need to buy a car. Only I have no idea where to start.

- I don't plan on driving it far, mostly 10km round trips to work, occasional weekend day trips and every now and then across the country, but I'll avoid that as a bus is 1/3 the price of petrol.

- I don't want a big car

- I don't want to spend more than 6k

I'd buy some cheap old banger but hear they're hard to insure. And then road tax has to be taken into account. I tried searching on adverts but they're are so many options. How much mileage is too much mileage? How old is too old? How big a tank do I need? Should I get petrol or diesel? HALP.

Go raibh maith agaibh!

Edit: I have a bike, it's not the solution. I cycled everywhere in Dublin but I have come to realise that if I only have my bike here I am going to spend all winter isolated and stuck inside. The roads are not safe to cycle in the dark where I live.
I wish I could just use the bike but public transport here is crap and the roads aren't safe. So, I have finally accepted I need a car.",2022-10-01 19:51:21
